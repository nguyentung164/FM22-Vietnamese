[BRK_LN] [%team#1-short] succumbed to a [%scoreline#1-winner_loser] loss at the hands of the depleted opposition and some questions will have to be asked as to why [%team#1-short] couldn't capitalise on their numerical advantage.

KEY-307155: \n[%comp#1]:- Number of matches - [%number#1], Last stage valid - [%stage_name#1]
KEY-307166: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] great run of form in recent weeks has seen the team emerge as serious title contenders, as predicted by the media and fans at the start of the season. [BRK_LN] The manager deserves credit for getting the best out of his side and many feel that if the club can keep up this excellent mid-season form, then they will be top of the table before too long.
KEY-307167: Despite their excellent league position, [%team#1-nickname] recent run of poor form has sent small ripples of concern through the club. [BRK_LN] The manager needs to turn things around quickly if they are to maintain their title challenge, but fans and pundits alike remain confident the team has the quality to bounce back stronger from this poor run.
KEY-307168: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] untimely struggle for form may cost them the title, fear supporters of the club. [BRK_LN] A recent run of below-par results has seen many wonder if the title favourites are not cracking under the pressure of maintaining a strong title challenge. [BRK_LN] The team will have to improve results quickly if they are to have any chance of lifting the title.
KEY-307169: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] can't expect to keep their position on top of the table if they keep failing to produce good performances on the pitch. [BRK_LN] Their recent run of poor form has started to put doubts into the minds of fans and media personnel and people are starting to question whether they are good enough to sustain a push for top spot and ultimately promotion.
KEY-307170: Widely tipped as favourites to gain promotion this season, [%team#1-nickname] have shown how good they are this season by staying in the automatic promotion spots for most of the season. [BRK_LN] Yet at this late stage of the campaign the recent run of poor form and performances are giving even their most ardent fans the promotion jitters.
KEY-307172: Although they are playing badly at the moment, the promotion favourites are still plugging away and are just about holding on to their position in the promotion places. [BRK_LN] Their fans will be disappointed with the way the team are performing, but still believe that the performances will get better as the season progresses.
KEY-307173: Despite their recent good form, [%team#1-nickname] have started the season looking like a team happy to consolidate against relegation rather than the promotion favourites they were hyped as during pre-season.
KEY-307174: Although they were widely tipped at the start of the campaign to just finish in the top half, [%team#1-nickname] have not wasted any time in climbing to the top end of the table. [BRK_LN] Although it is still early in the season, their current string of good results confirms their ambitions to finish as high as possible.
KEY-307175: {upper}[%team#1] are exceeding expectations by being in at the top end of the table with much of the season gone, thanks to some excellent recent performances. [BRK_LN] This defies early season predictions which had many media pundits suggesting that the club were little more than top-half makeweights.
KEY-307176: {upper}[%team#1] have stunned their rivals by being at the top end of the league as the league campaign reaches it latter stages. [BRK_LN] Some recent superb displays have added to the growing feeling in the media that [%team#1-short], despite not featuring as title contenders in any pre-season previews, are capable of finishing the season as champions.
KEY-307177: With the majority of pundits only having tipped [%team#1-nickname] for a finish in the top half this season, the team have surprised many by climbing to the top end of the league early in the campaign. [BRK_LN] Recent poor performances indicate however that it may not be long before the club find themselves slipping down the table.
KEY-307178: With the league season around the halfway mark, [%team#1-nickname] have surprised everyone by finding themselves in at the top end of the table, despite recent poor displays. [BRK_LN] In the light of this, it seems unlikely that the club, predicted by many at the start of the campaign to achieve little more than a top half finish, will hold on to top spot.
KEY-307179: With the season approaching its conclusion, [%team#1-short] continue to surprise by finding themselves at the top end of the table. [BRK_LN] The disappointing performances in recent matches will, however, lend credibility to the view that they are not good enough to hold their position at the top, and it looks as if the fans will have to settle for a finish that will still be considered more than satisfactory in the light of early season predictions.
KEY-307183: {upper}[%team#1] excellent run may finally have come to an end, but they still find themselves in a great position having exceeded pre-season expectations. [BRK_LN] It remains to be seen whether this setback will lead to the club slipping down the table, but for a side that was envisaged to be nothing more than top half makeweight, this still looks like being an excellent campaign for the men from [%stadium#1].
KEY-307184: This setback ended [%team#1] excellent unbeaten run, but the team still find themselves at the top end of the table in the end-of-season run in. [BRK_LN] Some fans are getting nervous as possible glory beckons, yet the club's faithful must surely be delighted with the way things are going with many having envisaged little more than a top half place at the start of the season.
KEY-307186: With the league season reaching its climax, [%team#1-nickname] are in the hunt for promotion, reinforcing their credentials with some tremendous recent displays. [BRK_LN] Despite being tipped to finish little better than mid-table back in pre-season, [%person#1-surname] men look set to defy these predictions by featuring strongly in the end-of-season run-in.
KEY-307187: As the season really beings to take shape, [%team#1-nickname] have surprised everyone by being in the promotion discussion. [BRK_LN] However, if the poor performances that have characterised recent games become a regular occurrence, it will seem that the team will finish in the unspectacular top half position predicted by the bookmakers at the start of the season.
KEY-307188: As the league season reaches its conclusion, it appears that [%team#1-nickname] may be about to slip out of the promotion chase as recent performances continue to disappoint. [BRK_LN] Having defied those that predicted no more than a reasonable top half finish for so long, it will be a real disappointment to the [%team#1-short] faithful if they do drop out of the promotion hunt at this late stage.
KEY-307190: Despite anticipating a comfortable season in the top half, [%team#1-nickname] find themselves stuck firmly in the relegation mire. [BRK_LN] As the team finds itself in a run of poor results, many fans are downbeat at their chances of escaping the drop and can only hope that the side recovers its form soon.
KEY-307191: In stark contrast to their pre-season ambitions of a top half finish, [%team#1-nickname] find themselves struggling to stave off the threat of relegation with much of the season gone. [BRK_LN] This win was a mighty relief for the fans, but it remains to be seen whether their side can haul themselves up the table.
KEY-307194: Despite a lengthy unbeaten run, this defeat leaves the team in a relegation dogfight with much of the season gone. [BRK_LN] With many having predicted they would see the side occupying a place in the top half of the table back in pre-season, [%team#1-nickname] faithful must be hoping that manager [%person#1-surname] can guide them out of trouble and start moving them up the table soon.
KEY-307195: Despite some encouraging performances, [%team#1-nickname] find themselves precariously involved in a relegation battle. [BRK_LN] With most of the season still to go however, the fans must be hoping that recent displays are a sign that the pre-season aim of a top half finish is certainly not beyond them.
KEY-307196: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] may have performed well of late but the team still find themselves embroiled in a relegation scrap. [BRK_LN] Having been tipped to figure in the top half back in pre-season, the [%team#1-short] faithful must be hoping that they will have moved further up the table come the end of the season.
KEY-307197: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] have certainly started the season in disappointing fashion as the disappointing displays leave them perilously close to a relegation fight. [BRK_LN] With plenty of the season still to go, everyone at the club must be hoping that the manager will turn things around soon and get the club back on course for their expected top half finish.
KEY-307198: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] are in serious trouble after recent poor performances left them flirting dangerously with relegation. [BRK_LN] The fans must be wishing that the season was already over as their expectation back in pre-season of a top half finish is now unreachable.
KEY-307199: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] much-needed win was a vital boost to a side that will be hoping to kick-start their season. [BRK_LN] Still finding themselves disappointingly close to a relegation fight, the team will be hoping that they can go on from here and work their way up to a more acceptable top half position by the end of the season.
KEY-307204: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] may have been on a run of good form but this defeat leaves them perilously close to being embroiled in a relegation battle. [BRK_LN] With the end of the season in sight, the team's priorities still lie with escaping relegation as the pre-season aim of a top half finish is now clearly beyond them.
KEY-307206: The strong form that [%team#1-nickname] are now showing means they are currently in the chase for a continental qualification spot. [BRK_LN] With the season really beginning to hot up, everyone at the club must be hoping they can continue this good form and stay with the league front-runners. [BRK_LN] This would certainly surprise those pundits who reckoned the club would fall short of landing qualification for continental competition this season.
KEY-307209: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] have stuttered badly and the fans can't be confident of holding on to the surprise continental qualification spot they are currently chasing. [BRK_LN] With much of the season still to go, it seems that the side are heading for a more likely finish further down the table.
KEY-307211: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] much-needed win should reignite the early season hopes of some optimistic fans that their side could be heading for a continental qualification place this season. [BRK_LN] However, some of the sceptics point to the recent form before this victory as showing that the team are destined to finish slightly further down the table.
KEY-307212: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] long-awaited victory has left the side currently hunting a qualification place, dreaming of continental qualification. [BRK_LN] After having been fancied in pre-season to do well to break into the top half, such a finish would represent a massive achievement for the club.
KEY-307213: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] vital win came at just the right time as they looked to be on the verge of sliding out of the continental qualification spots. [BRK_LN] With the season drawing to a close, everyone at the club is desperately hoping the team can hang on.
KEY-307214: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] setback after their strong early season form still sees them currently hunting a continental qualification spot. [BRK_LN] There may well be a long way to go, but qualifying for continental competition next season would represent an excellent achievement for a side many reckoned would be little more than top half makeweights this year.
KEY-307217: Although the season has only just started, relegation candidates [%team#1] find themselves at the top end of the league and playing superbly. [BRK_LN] Many feel that it won't last long though, and that their slide down the table is just around the corner.
KEY-307224: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] may have just won their first game in a while, but the pre-season favourites for the drop find themselves at the upper end of the table. [BRK_LN] However, another run of winless games would surely see them drop down the table.
KEY-307225: Having won their first games in ages, [%team#1-nickname] are showing that they're refusing to curl up and die. [BRK_LN] Relegation candidates before the season started, they now find themselves at the top end of the table as we enter the last few weeks of the season. [BRK_LN] Now the media are asking whether the unlikely contenders will be able to hold on to their position.
KEY-307226: {upper}[%team#1] run of games without losing may have come to an end, but they still find themselves at the business end of the league. [BRK_LN] However, the season has only just begun and many feel [%team#1-nickname] will soon take up their rightful position at the foot of the table.
KEY-307227: The surprise package of the season, [%team#1], have suffered their first defeat for a while. [BRK_LN] This does not seem to be too much of a setback as the pre-season relegation favourites find themselves at the right end of the league, but will they be able to bounce back in order to retain their unlikely position?
KEY-307229: Having just won their first game in ages, [%team#1-nickname] are pleasantly surprised to find themselves in the promotion race. [BRK_LN] Many felt the club would be struggling with relegation this season, but that has not proved to be the case. [BRK_LN] Considering there is still a large part of the season still to play, the question remains as to whether they will still be in the hunt for an automatic promotion place come the end of the campaign.
KEY-307230: Even [%team#1] recent run without a win hasn't dampened their season, with the pre-season relegation favourites still in the chase for an automatic promotion spot. [BRK_LN] Having now ended their recent run without a win, the media are asking whether they can now embark on an unbeaten run to make promotion a certainty. [BRK_LN] If they do, it will surely go down as one of the surprises of recent time.
KEY-307231: Despite having just suffered their first defeat in a while, relegation favourites [%team#1-nickname] remain in the chase for an automatic promotion spot. [BRK_LN] However, the club will need to make sure they get back to winning ways as soon as possible, or they may well find themselves battling against relegation rather than fighting for promotion.
KEY-307232: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] have looked unstoppable in recent weeks, but their first defeat for a while may yet end their unlikely promotion push. [BRK_LN] Many felt the club were certainties for relegation this season, but it has not proved the case. [BRK_LN] The club still harbour hopes of grabbing a promotion spot at this late stage in the season, but can they hold onto it till the end of the season?
KEY-307233: Few eyebrows have been raised by the way [%team#1-nickname] have started the season. [BRK_LN] The relegation favourites are currently at the bottom end of the table and although they've started stringing some results together recently, it looks set to be a long hard season for them.
KEY-307237: With the end of the season fast approaching [%team#1] find themselves, as predicted, in the lower reaches of the table. [BRK_LN] If recent performances are anything to go by, that's exactly where they deserve to be too. [BRK_LN] Declaring that this current [%team#1-short] team were not good enough to remain in the division, a former [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] player called on the club to admit they had simply not competed this season.
KEY-307247: In doing so, [%team#1-nickname] have finally managed to shake off their winless run and find themselves around the relegation zone. [BRK_LN] However, the relegation favourites cannot really afford another similar run throughout the rest of the season if they are to avoid the drop.
KEY-307248: Having managed to win their first game in ages, this winless run has still meant that the pre-season relegation candidates continue to find themselves in a fight to avoid the drop. [BRK_LN] Similar runs without victory between now and the end of the season would surely see the team sucked into the relegation zone and facing an uphill struggle to remain in the division.
KEY-307249: This victory has seen them end their run of games without a win. [BRK_LN] Unfortunately, they find themselves around the relegation zone with the end of the season fast approaching. [BRK_LN] Many were tipping [%team#1-nickname] for the drop this season and they will need to find more victories in upcoming games to stay up.
KEY-307250: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] may have just suffered their first defeat for a while, but here's no disguising the fact that they're still involved in a relegation battle. [BRK_LN] Having been tipped for the drop this season however, a safe position come the end of the season would be seen as a great success.
KEY-307251: Having been tipped for relegation this season, [%team#1-nickname] position keeps them in the midst of a fight to avoid the drop. [BRK_LN] However, fans will feel that their recent unbeaten run should really have moved them further away from the relegation zone and they will need to get back to winning ways sooner rather than later to preserve their status in this division.
KEY-307252: With the end of the season fast approaching [%team#1-nickname] undefeated run had looked to be a blessing. [BRK_LN] However, with the run now having ended with the side still embroiled in a fight against the drop, the pre-season relegation favourites will need a few more wins to ensure they avoid relegation.
KEY-307253: Despite their recent poor form however, the club have surprised many people this season as they were strongly fancied to go down. [BRK_LN] Finding themselves in mid-table with the end of the campaign quickly approaching, [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans will surely be hoping that it is too late for them to be involved in a relegation fight.
KEY-307255: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] were strongly tipped for the drop this season, but they currently find themselves sitting in the top half of the table and battling to qualify for continental football next season. [BRK_LN] However unlikely that may sound, if they continue their current form, the club could well cause an upset and qualify.
KEY-307284: It now seems a foregone conclusion that [%team#1-short] will eventually miss out on continental football. [BRK_LN] Although in a position to qualify at the moment, the team are now playing like the lower half team everyone expected them to be.
KEY-307289: With the club expected to struggle this season, [%team#1-nickname] early form, although slightly dented by this defeat, leaves them contemplating continental football at the moment.
KEY-307295: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] fans daren't hope that the team can maintain its position at the business end of the table over these final few weeks of the season. [BRK_LN] Many predicted a mid-table finish at best for the club, but they have confounded critics to sit at the upper end of the standings and fans are hoping that the club can remain in this unexpected position until the end of the season.
KEY-307296: After a run of poor results, [%team#1-nickname] fans must be hoping that the side can return to the superb form which saw them climb to the upper reaches of the table. [BRK_LN] While experts continue to insist that recent results show the bubble has burst, fans are hoping the team can confound predictions once again and get back to winning ways as quickly as possible.
KEY-307297: Critics are suggesting that their poor recent form suggests that unlikely league contenders [%team#1-nickname] are finally cracking under the strain of competing at the top of the table. [BRK_LN] Most believe the team lacks the necessary experience to remain at the top over these final few weeks of the season.
KEY-307298: Although recording their first win in a while, [%team#1-nickname] still sit proudly up the table, confounding their critics who had predicted only a season of mid-table mediocrity. [BRK_LN] Critics though have been quick to point out that being up at the top at such an early point in the season means little when it comes to the final reckoning.
KEY-307299: Critics could be forced to eat their words after they predicted that [%team#1-nickname] spell at the top end of the table would end quickly after their recent run of poor form. [BRK_LN] Recording this vital win in their last game has led many fans to hope that this will be the start of another fine run of results.
KEY-307300: Despite predictions that their position at the top end of the division would soon be over, [%team#1-nickname] win has kept them up with the elite at the top. [BRK_LN] Fans and staff are pinching themselves at the club's position and hope the team can hold itself together over these crucial final few weeks of the season.
KEY-307301: As [%team#1-nickname] sit proudly at the top end of the table, even this defeat could not dislodge them from their lofty standing. [BRK_LN] Fans of the club are delighted with early season performances and it gives them great optimism for the remainder of the season.
KEY-307303: Perennially a mid-table side, [%team#1-nickname] have confounded their critics at this late stage of the season to remain relevant at top of the league. [BRK_LN] However, these same critics have stated that the players' lack of experience at being in the thick of a title dogfight could count against them in these final few weeks of the season.
KEY-307308: Predictions of a season of mid-table anonymity for [%team#1-nickname] have been shown to be well and truly inaccurate of late. [BRK_LN] A great run of recent form has seen the side move into contention for a continental qualification place and even their harshest critics have been forced to admire the way the team has played so far this season.
KEY-307309: There are broad smiles on the faces of {upper}[%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans once again. [BRK_LN] A fine recent run has seen the club move into contention for continental qualification next season and has also electrified the whole of the club's faithful support. [BRK_LN] The manager and his team have received nothing but praise in recent weeks for making such radical improvements at the club, who at the start of the season were widely tipped for a mid-table finish at best.
KEY-307320: Just as [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans were starting to believe their side could be surprise winners of this season's title, a recent slump in form has them concerned. [BRK_LN] At this stage of the season the team cannot afford to lose many more games and still maintain their standing at the top end of the table. [BRK_LN] Although pre-season expectations of qualification for continental competition would have represented a decent season, a similar achievement given their current position would be something of an anti-climax.
KEY-307324: After a fantastic run of results which saw the team catapulted to the top end of the table, [%team#1-nickname] finally experienced defeat in their last game. [BRK_LN] Fans are delighted with the progress the club has made this season however and feel that the team is well positioned to exceed the pre-season predictions of a continental qualification spot.
KEY-307326: Although early season form has been largely indifferent, [%team#1-nickname] are still tipped for a continental place by many after a good run of form saw them rise up the table. [BRK_LN] However, many critics feel that the team is going to have to produce more consistency if they are to fulfil expectations this season.
KEY-307327: After a disappointing start to the season, [%team#1-nickname] have bounced back of late with a good run of form and some excellent performances. [BRK_LN] Whilst not yet in the continental qualification places, it is felt that if the side can maintain its current fine form, it will only be a matter of time before they climb the table.
KEY-307328: With time running out in the season, [%team#1-nickname] are desperate to put together a strong end to the campaign and sneak continental qualification. [BRK_LN]  A recent run of fine results has given the club a chance of pinching a qualification spot, but many feel the club should have established itself in the thick of that race before now.
KEY-307329: Early season predictions of a place in continental competition for [%team#1-nickname] last season seem wide of the mark after the club plunged to another defeat this week. [BRK_LN] Unless the manager and his players can turn things around quickly, the club could well find itself embroiled in a mid table slog rather than pushing for continental football.
KEY-307331: It looks like being a season of disappointment for [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans. [BRK_LN] Their team slumped to another poor performance and with games running out, the team will have to put together a miraculous run of results in order to qualify for continental football now. [BRK_LN] Many experts feel its time for the manager to ring the changes to try and halt this recent run of poor form.
KEY-307332: After a poor recent run, [%team#1-nickname] must be looking to put together a string of fine results after they recorded a much-needed win in their last game. [BRK_LN] The team has been widely tipped for a continental qualification spot this season, but unless their form improves radically over the mid and latter stages of the season, it may well mean a season of mid-table anonymity for the club.
KEY-307333: A victory in their last game cannot hide the fact that [%team#1-nickname] have not really done themselves justice so far this season. [BRK_LN] Mid-table is not what fans of the club have come to expect, and unless the manager can turn the side into genuine continental qualification candidates over the coming months, he will undoubtedly find himself under increasing pressure.
KEY-307340: Their recent form had been better, but [%team#1-nickname] tasted defeat once again in this last game. [BRK_LN] It has been a massively disappointing start to the season for the club, hotly tipped as potential qualifiers for continental football, and the pressure on the manager is already growing from disillusioned fans and former players.
KEY-307345: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] surge up the table came to a halt after the defeat in this last game. [BRK_LN] After a dreadful start to the season, recent form had been much improved and given fans some hope that if the team could continue in a consistent vein for the remainder of the season, they could still force themselves into continental qualification contention.
KEY-307346: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] recent form has seen them improve their league standing. [BRK_LN] Currently in mid-table, the fans of the club will be expecting their team to improve a great deal over the remainder of the season to try and gain a place in continental competition.
KEY-307347: Whilst their recent form has been vastly improved compared to the rest of the season, [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans will not be too happy at finishing the league in mid-table. [BRK_LN] Manager [%person#1-surname] knows the club were expected to take a continental qualification spot this season and he must now realise that only a very strong finish will convince fans that this season has not been a complete waste.
KEY-307348: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] are losing their tenuous grip on a chance of continental football next season. [BRK_LN] This latest defeat has compounded the team's problems recently, and the manager will have to think carefully about his team selection over these final few weeks of the season if they are to register a morale-boosting win quickly and give the team just a slight chance of getting back into contention.
KEY-307349: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] alarming slide down the table ended with a fine win in their last game. [BRK_LN] Experts' predictions of a continental qualification place for the team this season looked ill-founded after a recent run of defeats, but this win may well give the team a shot in the arm and enable them to move back up to the table.
KEY-307350: After poor recent form, [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans could be forgiven for thinking their side are close to blowing their chances of continental qualification. [BRK_LN] However, a morale-boosting win in their last game halted the club's precarious slide and fans are more upbeat about the club's chances in the second half of the season.
KEY-307351: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] fans feel that the club's win in their last game is rather like closing the door after the horse has bolted. An ill-timed slump in form has seen the club fall into mid table and though this win puts them back in with a chance, many feel that the chance of continental qualification has already passed the club by.
KEY-307352: After a slow start [%team#1-nickname] had returned to form of late, but that has now all come to an end. [BRK_LN] Although in mid-table, fans remain optimistic that the positive signs coming from the side during the recent good run will continue into the remainder of the season and that a continental qualification place is still within the club's grasp.
KEY-307353: A disappointing defeat has all but ended [%team#1-nickname] hopes of achieving a continental qualification place this season. [BRK_LN] Recent form had given the fans hopes of sneaking a place, but this latest setback means it is going to be very difficult for the team to achieve anything other than mid-table anonymity this season.
KEY-307356: Although currently in a continental qualification spot, [%team#1-nickname] fans will know that their team's recent slump does not bode well for the future. [BRK_LN] The team will have to halt its slide in performance quickly if they are to maintain their challenge near the top of the table.
KEY-307357: Poor recent form has given [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans something to think over. [BRK_LN] Currently contending, as expected, for the continental qualification positions, the team is going to have to bounce back quickly from their recent slump in form if they are to maintain their challenge over the final months of the season.
KEY-307358: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] late season slump could not have come at a worse time. [BRK_LN] The club are hanging grimly on to continental qualification contention presently, but if the team cannot arrest this recent slide, then it is likely that any of the chasing pack could take the vital position from the team over the final few weeks of the campaign.
KEY-307362: After succumbing to their first defeat in a long time, [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans remain defiant that the team can take their great recent form into the second half of the season. [BRK_LN] Predictions of continental qualification do seem well-founded and some even hope the team might force its way into the championship reckoning.
KEY-307365: {upper}[%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans are adamant that defeat in their last game was just a minor blip in what has been an otherwise superb start to the season. [BRK_LN] Whilst experts continue to predict that the club will only achieve a continental qualification berth at best, fans of the club maintain that, under the current manager, the team is well-equipped to make a real challenge for the title this season.
KEY-307367: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] performances will have to improve if they are to mount a serious title challenge this season. [BRK_LN] Although they are at the top of the league, their recent performances have indicated they are unlikely to remain there for long.
KEY-307368: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] supporters must be hoping that their side will soon return to their early season form that put them up at the top end of the table. [BRK_LN] It will be hard to see them mounting a serious title challenge if their recent form continues much longer.
KEY-307369: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] are starting to look capable of turning their title dream into a nightmare. [BRK_LN] They may still be at the top end of the league, but if they continue to play like they have done in recent games, they may find themselves watching one of the chasing pack snatch the glory.
KEY-307370: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] have finally earned maximum points and brought a halt to their recent winless streak. [BRK_LN] This much-improved performance will help to justify their position at the business end of the league.
KEY-307371: After a crucial win to break their recent string of poor results, [%team#1-nickname] will be hopeful they can build on the result and strengthen their standing at the top end of the league.
KEY-307373: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] have been reminded what defeat tastes like for the first time in a while. [BRK_LN] They will want to ensure they can bounce straight back if they are to preserve their impressive standing at the upper end of the table.
KEY-307811: It doesn't matter at all, the team playing the later fixture still know they need to win regardless of what has gone on beforehand

KEY-352849: Everyone's keen to dress this up as something more than it is. There are controversial decisions in every game; we win some, we lose some, and we move on
KEY-352858: Football's a funny game, who knows what's going to happen?
KEY-352859: For every decision that goes our way, there's at least three that don't. Nobody ever wants to ask me about those
KEY-352863: He's extremely consistent and reliable, the type of player every manager would love to have. We have to find a way to marginalise him

KEY-352871: If I believed it had any influence whatsoever it might lead me to become complacent. Besides, [%person#2-first] might be getting a bit fed up of losing players to us

KEY-352873: If I was [%team#2-short] fan I would be very concerned
KEY-352874: If he chooses to remain blind to the obvious flaws then I can't see him lasting much longer there
KEY-352875: If he feels we can be exposed then we'll obviously have to take that into consideration
KEY-352876: If he's prepared to embarrass [%person#2-himself] with outrageous claims, who am I to intervene. He has no idea how wrong he is
KEY-352877: If [%team#2-short] can manage their squad well and maybe make one or two key additions at the right time, they'll do exactly as I've said, but everyone else will be doing their best to push them as hard as possible

KEY-352883: If they can identify our key men and do a job against them, then they're certainly in with a chance. It's a big if, though
KEY-352884: If they don't believe in themselves then perhaps it's a chance for somebody else to seize the initiative. I know we're going to give it our best shot
KEY-352885: If they've lost their heads and lost their belief, somebody else with a stronger will to win is going to step up and be counted
KEY-352886: If things continue as they are right now, probably not, but things are constantly changing and other teams seem confident enough
KEY-352887: If we had greater squad depth and manoeuvrability then I think we'd be much better off, but as it stands I sort of agree

KEY-352894: In response to your very obvious grievances over the recent red card controversy, [%person#2] suggested your claims were without justification and that his team were fully deserving of the decision. Would you care to respond?
KEY-352895: In response to suggestions the [%stadium#1] pitch was not up to standard, [%person#2] had plenty to say about you and [%team#1-short] in response. Do you have any further thoughts on the matter?
KEY-352896: In situations where teams are so closely matched on the pitch, the mental aspect of the game can be decisive. It sounds like they don't believe in themselves, which bodes well for the other contenders
KEY-352898: Is there an argument to be made that [%team#1-short] get the majority of debatable decisions going their way?
KEY-352900: It absolutely does. When you're able to fully understand where somebody else is coming from, everything is clear and there are no grey areas
KEY-352901: It absolutely does. I have to trust people and they have to trust me; and I know it's the same for other managers
KEY-352902: It all reeks of sour grapes really doesn't it? Things didn't go his way so he's making excuses to try to cloud the fact he was outplayed today, it's pretty typical of him I'm afraid
KEY-352905: It is a bit of a worry, the pitch has been cutting up quite a lot recently and it makes good, flowing football difficult, maybe that's why [%person#2-first] seems so reluctant to address the surface. We'll look to deal with it as well as we can but it's far from ideal
KEY-352906: It makes very little sense and I'm sure everyone involved will come to their senses sooner rather than later
KEY-352907: It might not be, but it's not going to stop me from raising concerns
KEY-352908: It might sound harsh but I just don't think he's cut out for football at this level
KEY-352909: It raised a smile and caused a few laughs in the dressing room. [%person#2-surname] appears to be losing the plot!
KEY-352910: It remains to be seen if [%person#2-surname] was saying things for effect or if he genuinely believes in his words. If it's the latter, then I'll be happy
KEY-352911: It saves time and it saves stress, plus with each successful deal the trust increases. It suits everyone
KEY-352912: It seems fair, he certainly has a case for inclusion over a number of others
KEY-352913: It seems such a random and arbitrary decision. It's very hard to work out the reasoning behind their hire
KEY-352914: It seems to be happening and I can't help but think there's going to be a queue of suitors. I know I'd love him here!
KEY-352916: It sounds like they're throwing in the towel prematurely. Whether that means the door opens for us or for somebody else isn't clear but we're going to find out
KEY-352918: It was a diabolical decision and if [%person#2-surname] is claiming it wasn't a penalty then I feel sorry for him because he's deluded
KEY-352919: It was a diabolical decision and if [%person#2-surname] is claiming otherwise then I feel sorry for him because he's deluded
KEY-352924: It wasn't ideal to play more than I had asked but I do appreciate it's not always easy for [%person#2-first] to juggle everything and still put out a competitive team
KEY-352925: It won't be easy, that much is already clear. It would certainly have been better to be dealing with a more accommodating partner, but it is what it is
KEY-352927: It wouldn't make much sense for me to restrict potential transfer dealings based on who I do and do not like. I'm always open to suggestions
KEY-352928: It's my intention to be there or thereabouts come the end of the season. We'll see who's closer to being right then
KEY-352929: It's my intention to finish with our heads above water come the end of the season. We'll see who's closer to being right then
KEY-352930: It's a bit of a pointless discussion really; we might get one or two things go our way from time to time, but so does every team
KEY-352931: It's a case of there being many, many more suitable candidates for the job than [%person#2-surname]
KEY-352934: It's a tired debate which is so often misunderstood from the outside. I have a job to do and I'm going to do whatever it takes to be successful.
KEY-352935: It's a tired debate which is so often misunderstood from the outside. I have a job to do and I'm going to do whatever it takes to be successful
KEY-352939: It's always an option. Developing a clear pathway into our first team is hugely important to me and the idea of building a relationship with someone like [%person#2-first] to help us do that is something which appeals
KEY-352941: It's always useful to be able to go to someone you get along with and discuss things with them. It's not as if we'll be trading players like football stickers but there's room for discussion
KEY-352942: It's appropriate if the question is asked. I might choose a different way to handle things, but that's a different matter altogether
KEY-352943: It's been a good season so far but it counts for nothing if we're not on our game right until the end. The boys are in good spirits and we're going forward with a positive attitude
KEY-352946: It's easier said than done. I can appreciate the concern for aggravating recent injuries but this is international football.
KEY-352949: It's hard to really look forward to it when we're on a hiding to nothing. We've got everything to lose and very little to gain by being the bigger team. They're much smaller, they don't have the same problem
KEY-352950: It's important to understand that each deal is unique and has its own intricacies. What's happened before doesn't necessarily impact the future
KEY-352951: It's just what I was hoping to hear. Any complacency on their side gives us an even greater chance of pulling off a win
KEY-352952: It's laughable really, I can't begin to see where he's coming from. It certainly makes me a lot more confident of a win
KEY-352953: It's massive for a club like ours. I know that [%person#2-first] is always going to be open to suggestions and the standard of player he can provide is consistently high
KEY-352954: It's nice to hear [%person#2-first] speak of us in such a manner. We fully intend to give [%team#2-short] a game and we have genuine belief that we can win
KEY-352956: It's not always easy. For a start, the right players in the right positions have to be available at the right time, and that's not as regular an occurrence as you might think
KEY-352957: It's not going to be easy, but we're going to try to enjoy ourselves at least
KEY-352958: It's not like they're the only club doing it. I could be barking up the wrong tree!
KEY-352959: It's not really for me to say, anything could have gone on behind the scenes to lead to [%person#2-first] taking those measures
KEY-352960: It's not something you'll find me doing very often but that's a different story. [%male#3-first] is just one of a number of very good players here and if they're going to focus on him alone, then it bodes well for us
KEY-352961: It's not that easy to sort the wheat from the chaff; just because a manager or a club have a previously impressive record doesn't mean they'll keep it up, nor does it mean other clubs can't improve
KEY-352963: It's nothing more than mind games. We're all playing for places behind them now
KEY-352965: It's obviously nice to hear those comments but I'm fully aware that we're up against it and that it's going to be a tough proposition
KEY-352966: It's often quite misunderstood but if it's well-executed it can be very successful
KEY-352967: It's rare that the full duration of the match doesn't represent what happened during it. It was a fair result
KEY-352968: It's really not as organised and structured as it seems. I'm constantly looking out for good players, and [%person#2-first] has got some. That's as far as it goes!
KEY-352970: It's shaping up to be a great season and whilst [%team#2-short] are going great guns, we're very much going to fight them the whole way
KEY-352972: It's the toughest time of the season and I'm undoubtedly going to find out whether my squad has what it takes. I can't say I know for sure at this stage
KEY-352973: It's tough. Whether that's because certain personalities conflict or because people are concerned with getting one over on someone else I don't know, but it can be a long old slog at times
KEY-352974: It's ultimately up to each manager and club, but whilst it's worked well for us at times, it's always good to keep a wider range of options available
KEY-352981: Like any manager, I want what's best for the club and my players. If [%person#2-first] and others have proven themselves useful to us, then it makes sense to keep a good thing going
KEY-352982: Lots of managers get in touch and ask for favourable use of their players in these situations. It's easier said than done
KEY-352987: No disrespect intended towards [%male#3-first], because he knows how much I think of him, but I was surprised to hear [%person#2-surname] say that
KEY-352989: No, it's not. It's irresponsible and it blocks the pathways into first team football for our youngsters
KEY-352992: Not in the slightest. I can't say such a thought had entered my mind before you raised it
KEY-352996: Of course I do. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but I tend not to listen
KEY-352997: Of course it's not justified; [%person#2-surname] is talking nonsense as usual
KEY-352999: On the contrary; I think he'll end up surprising many
KEY-353000: Part of me thinks it's just mind-games and an attempt to unsettle the club
KEY-353001: People don't agree on every single thing; it's perfectly fine if he thinks it was worthy of a red card. I didn't, and most importantly, neither did the referee
KEY-353002: Perhaps, but I'd make the argument that we're deserving of most of them
KEY-353011: Probably. It's much easier to deal with people when you get along well with them rather than face the potential of conflict
KEY-353013: Since it's still obviously a hot topic, hopefully something will be done by the powers that be
KEY-353015: Some people simply wouldn't have it that we could get a result here. They were wrong, and we're going to continue proving people wrong
KEY-353016: Somebody has to speak out before we reach the tipping point in the transfer market
KEY-353018: Surely though, clubs should be obliged to meet a certain standard of quality? The pitch today was terrible and made for a poor spectacle
KEY-353019: Teams should be punished if they can't produce a good enough pitch, simple as that. Fine them, deduct points, whatever you want, but they can't get away with it
KEY-353020: That has to be the aim; if the player isn't ready for the first team here then the next best place for them to go is a trusted environment under a manager with similar ideas and methods. [%person#2-first] could be that manager
KEY-353021: That's a bit of a stretch! He might be able to see what we do well but stopping us from playing is something else. I'm confident
KEY-353022: That's a bit of a stretch. This deal happened to suit us both, but that's not to say that it'll be the case for every conceivable situation
KEY-353023: That's certainly a part of it. [%person#2-first] comes across as a manager very much in tune with development and his players always appear well schooled
KEY-353024: That's easy for him to say, the surface was a nightmare and really hampered our efforts to string any passes together. I guess that's something that he feels better equipped to deal with but I'm not at all happy with the pitch today
KEY-353026: That's how I'm hoping for it go, yes
KEY-353029: That's one way of looking at it, but to be honest I was expecting a tough match anyway. [%person#2-first] knows what he doing
KEY-353031: The Wide Target Man will be the main outlet for clearances and long balls from the back. Ideally positioned against a smaller and weaker full-back, he will be asked to get hold of the ball and keep it before recycling it to a team-mate.
KEY-353033: The fun and games have already started. I'm focusing on what is undoubtedly going to be a very long and tiring campaign
KEY-353034: The pitch certainly didn't help but it was the same for both sides and I have to give a lot of credit to [%person#2-first] for getting a great performance from his lads
KEY-353035: The pitch obviously wasn't in the best condition but we had done our homework and made sure we were prepared for it and I think that shows in the result. We didn't allow ourselves to get bogged down with it if you'll pardon the pun!
KEY-353036: The surface was fine, I honestly don't know what he's moaning about, we coped absolutely fine with it so he has to ask [%person#2-himself] why his side failed to do the same
KEY-353038: The transfer market is a very murky business and it's rarely straight-forward to get something done. When I have the opportunity to work with someone like [%person#2-first], who has proven his worth before, I look to take it
KEY-353039: There is no long-term in football, things change so quickly that it's impossible to speak of anything that far down the line
KEY-353041: There's a long way yet to go and whilst it's easy to talk, we'll see what transpires
KEY-353042: There's a lot of good teams in the picture and I'm not sure we're better than all of them right now
KEY-353043: There's definitely some tension and nervousness creeping in. The players know how costly one mistake could be and need to channel that into a positive frame of mind otherwise this could end in tears
KEY-353044: There's no specific strategy to this; it's merely coincidence
KEY-353045: There's no such thing as an easy game in football and I'm intent on making sure that my players know just how much of a threat [%team#2-short] are capable of posing
KEY-353046: They got a few lucky breaks and a lucky result. The true margin of difference between us and them will be on display for everyone to see next time
KEY-353047: They have to think they can do it, otherwise they don't have a chance. My players have faith in themselves and who knows, maybe that will help us in the latter half of the campaign
KEY-353048: They have to think they can win the title, otherwise they don't have a chance. My players have faith in themselves and who knows, maybe that will help us in the latter half of the campaign
KEY-353049: They should at least explore the opportunity should one arise
KEY-353050: They're a very impressive team and despite being defeated, we can take more away from this than we would've been able to from 99% of matches
KEY-353051: They're in a good position and look good for safety to me
KEY-353052: They're in a good position and look good to mount a real challenge as the season goes on
KEY-353054: Things went in your side's favour out there despite the much-discussed condition of the playing surface, do you think it had any impact on the result?
KEY-353055: This isn't the first time you've singled out an opponent for criticism in the build-up to a match. Is it a deliberate ploy to instigate a degree of psychological mind games with your opposite number?
KEY-353056: This isn't the first time you've singled out an opponent for praise in the build-up to a match. Is it a deliberate ploy to instigate a degree of psychological mind games with your opposite number?
KEY-353057: To me he's just a fantastic footballer and his contribution to [%team#2-short] is a massive reason behind them being a threat to us
KEY-353058: To be honest it's not so much about him being good as it is the rest of their squad not being up to standard. He's the best of a bad bunch
KEY-353059: To be honest there are so many people to deal with when working out a transfer that actual manager to manager face time is fairly minimal
KEY-353068: Unfortunately I have to go through this at times, and begrudgingly so. I can be obstinate here and there, and other managers will be just as problematic
KEY-353069: Unfortunately, [%person#2-surname] seems to have made [%person#2-himself] very clear as to the chances of this deal happening
KEY-353072: We all know how quickly things can change in football so nothing's set in stone yet, but with time running out you have to think [%team#2-short] are in the best position they could be in
KEY-353074: We deserve to be favourites because we're in the strongest position. My squad are ready for the challenge and we have confidence in ourselves
KEY-353075: We haven't come this far to slip up and let somebody else stay in this division at our expense. We're staying here
KEY-353077: We haven't come this far to slip up and let somebody else take our glory. We're going up
KEY-353079: We'll have a plan for that match, just as we do for every other fixture
KEY-353080: We're going to give it everything we've got and work as hard as possible but there's every chance we'll simply run out of steam
KEY-353081: We're going to keep going for as long as we can so as to be in position to take advantage of any unpredictable results, and then we'll see what happens
KEY-353082: We're in negotiations but I think it's fairly likely. I've been impressed with what I've seen and think it's good for everyone
KEY-353083: We're just going to go about our business now and, with a bit of luck, we'll see our own share of decisions
KEY-353084: We're not going to see eye to eye on this, clearly, but I stand by my assertions
KEY-353085: We've done well so far, hopefully we can keep going until we reach the finish line and keep our heads above water
KEY-353088: Weird things happen at this time of the season. I certainly couldn't possibly predict the outcome
KEY-353092: What are your thoughts on [%person#2] claims that [%team#1-short] don't have what it takes to see this promotion challenge through to completion and that your team simply 'doesn't have the bottle'?
KEY-353093: What are your thoughts on [%person#2] claims that [%team#1-short] don't have what it takes to see this title challenge through to completion and that your team simply 'doesn't have the bottle'?
KEY-353094: What are your thoughts on [%person#2] claims that [%team#1-short] don't have what it takes to stay up and that your team simply 'doesn't have the bottle'?
KEY-353101: What are the chances of you sending [%male#3] on loan to [%team#2-short] after [%person#2] declared an interest in his services? Do you consider him the right person to help develop your talent?
KEY-353105: What have you made of [%team#2-short] [%job#2] [%person#2] words on the structure in place at [%team#1-short]? He had some very opinionated comments
KEY-353120: With all due respect, I don't really care about what he has to say. It's my decision and [%male#3-first] will remain [%team#1-short] player
KEY-353121: With hindsight, I don't like it very much when my players are spoken about by others, so it falls on me to behave accordingly in future
KEY-353123: With the finish line now well and truly within sight, how do you see things unfolding over the final weeks of the season? Are you amongst those who consider [%team#2-short] to be the favourites for promotion?
KEY-353128: With this approach, players are expected to contribute to fewer phases of play than with the Balanced philosophy. [BRK_LN] Central defenders are responsible only for the defensive phase. The full backs and more defensive midfielders are responsible for both defensive and transition phases. The wingers and more attacking midfielders are responsible for both transition and attacking phases. The forwards are responsible only for the attacking phase. [BRK_LN] The team will be expected to keep its shape and play precise and controlled football with players allowed less creative freedom.
KEY-353129: With this approach, players are expected to contribute to more phases of play than with the Balanced philosophy. [BRK_LN] The team is split into broad attacking and defensive units with the more creative players responsible for the attacking phase and the more defensively disciplined players responsible for the defensive phase. However, players from each unit are expected to move into the transition phase when the right opportunity arises. [BRK_LN] The team will be encouraged to play more flowing football with players allowed more creative freedom.
KEY-353130: With this approach, players are expected to contribute to more than one phase of play. [BRK_LN] Defenders and more defensive midfielders are responsible for both defensive and transition phases and more attacking midfielders and forwards are responsible for both transition and attack phases. [BRK_LN] The team will aim to find a balance between the movement of players within the system and keeping its shape.
KEY-353131: Without knowing all of the details, I'm inclined to side with the manager in these situations
KEY-353408: I wouldn't ready much into those comments; we're both playing the same game here and [%team#2-short] are more than good enough
KEY-353409: I wouldn't ready much into those comments; we're both playing the same game here and maybe [%team#2-short] will be better than expected
KEY-353410: I wouldn't rule anything out but I won't be actively seeking him out any time soon
KEY-353414: I wouldn't say that I'm hopeful; I've found out the hard way that even the best of friends have their differences and when it comes to transfer dealings, people can be set in their ways and refuse to negotiate
KEY-353417: I wouldn't say there's much of a relationship to speak of in the first place, let alone something which would've aided this process
KEY-353418: I'd be interested in that type of link-up, as long as it was right for everyone involved. There would be a number of ways in which we could benefit from that
KEY-353424: I'd prefer to discuss the match itself really, the pitch discussion has been done to death and I really don't have anything to add
KEY-353430: I'd rather take each situation as it comes and deal with them accordingly instead of pre-determining moves which may not work out
KEY-353432: I'd willingly deal with anyone if the right offer came in at the right time. [%person#2-first] just manages to be one of the few who can apparently muster a realistic scenario
KEY-353436: I'm a bit concerned, the surface isn't at all conducive to a good game of football and both sides will have to deal with it as well as they can
KEY-353438: I'm always happy to see [%team#1-short] players represent their country, although it would have been nice if [%person#2-first] had found a way to accommodate my requests
KEY-353439: I'm always happy to see [%team#1-short] players represent their country, although it would have been nice to get some much needed rest for them
KEY-353440: I'm always happy to see [%team#1-short] players represent their country, despite the risk of aggravating recent injuries.
KEY-353441: I'm always looking for ways to improve this club and if that approach helps, then so be it, but I'm not entirely sure it does
KEY-353442: I'm always wary of the favourites tag because we've got everything to lose from our position. The players have to remain focused and it's harder than ever when the stakes are at their highest
KEY-353443: I'm amazed we got a good result on that pitch, it's absolutely unacceptable that we should have to put up with a surface like that in this day and age and it's something I'd like to think will be addressed
KEY-353445: I'm baffled by it; he's got no business being in the squad
KEY-353446: I'm confident we'll be just fine. [%person#2-surname] comments will only serve to give them the extra few yards they might have otherwise lacked!
KEY-353448: I'm delighted with that given the circumstances, the pitch was an absolute state and we were very fortunate to get a positive result, it really is something that needs addressing soon though
KEY-353451: I'm disappointed that he seemed to ignore my instructions. They were issued for a reason and my plans may now be compromised as a result
KEY-353453: I'm disappointed; [%team#2-short] have been ridiculously lucky there
KEY-353457: I'm happy to let [%person#2-first] keep talking about this rather than comment too much myself
KEY-353458: I'm happy to take [%male#3-first] on loan but I've not been quite so impressed with the rest of the players they'd probably like to send here
KEY-353459: I'm happy with our performance, just not the manner in which the game unfolded late on. If he thinks otherwise, let him think that way
KEY-353462: I'm hardly surprised at [%person#2-surname] response and I don't think any of you were either. He's laughable
KEY-353463: I'm hardly surprised at [%person#2-surname] response and I don't think any of you were either. He's laughable
KEY-353464: I'm hardly surprised to hear [%person#2-first] wants to keep one of his better players. It's easier said than done
KEY-353465: I'm hardly surprised, he gets the rub of the green more often than not. You'd think that sort of luck would run out at some point.
KEY-353466: I'm hardly surprised, he gets the rub of the green more often than not. You'd think that sort of luck would run out at some point
KEY-353467: I'm hopeful of things turning out well for us but there's a growing tension amongst the players that doesn't exactly fill me with confidence. Hopefully we can regain our focus
KEY-353468: I'm hoping for the story to die down because quite honestly, there's a truckload of nonsense being written and published about it
KEY-353469: I'm inclined to believe it's something over nothing or there's somebody with an agenda at work here. It can't happen, surely not?
KEY-353470: I'm intrigued that [%person#2-surname] appears to have such a strong grip on the mental strength of my players. I'm far less concerned than he is, put it that way
KEY-353471: I'm just glad to get it out of the way. It's never easy taking on a much smaller team and hopefully we can focus on the bigger tasks to come
KEY-353472: I'm keen for [%male#3-first] to keep his head and remain focused instead of getting into friendly discussions with [%person#2-surname]
KEY-353473: I'm keen to find out more but the signs are positive so far and I'm looking forward to seeing how [%male#3-first] fares under [%person#2-first]
KEY-353474: I'm looking forward to getting stuck into the middle of the season and setting ourselves up for the long haul. I wish [%person#2-first] the best of luck as well
KEY-353477: I'm looking to improve the squad by any means possible and it's always advantageous to pick from good stock, which is very much the case here
KEY-353478: I'm more interested in discussing elements of my own club
KEY-353479: I'm not a fan of it and think it's a relatively cheap way of doing your job
KEY-353480: I'm not a fan of punishing people for speaking their mind
KEY-353481: I'm not about to go on record with a claim that will be talked about all season. I'm not that stupid!
KEY-353482: I'm not as pleased as [%person#2-surname] probably thinks I am. We could have played a lot better in most of our games
KEY-353483: I'm not at liberty to discuss transfer dealings at this stage
KEY-353484: I'm not convinced by them, I think they lack staying power and will ultimately perish
KEY-353485: I'm not convinced by them, I think they lack staying power
KEY-353486: I'm not doing my job properly if I'm not constantly looking for that edge to get one over on somebody else. It's up to them how they receive such comments
KEY-353487: I'm not especially pleased with his recent conduct; there are classy ways to handle affairs and he certainly hasn't acted in such a manner
KEY-353488: I'm not going to be drawn into these silly games right now
KEY-353489: I'm not going to become complacent over a few pre-match comments. We'll prepare for this match in the same way we do every week and we'll be ready for anything
KEY-353491: I'm not going to get into that debate, it's been done many times before
KEY-353492: I'm not going to get into those discussions at this stage. Let somebody else make the headlines instead
KEY-353493: I'm not going to give an answer which could potentially make me look silly!
KEY-353495: I'm not in the business of selling all of my good players, so whilst it's always good to work out a positive deal, they don't come along very often
KEY-353496: I'm not looking for sympathy, I made the comments with a purpose in mind
KEY-353497: I'm not looking forward to being reminded of these comments every week for the rest of the season, that's for sure
KEY-353498: I'm not one to pry into somebody else's business. It's not my decision to make, I simply think he's a superb player and in great form
KEY-353499: I'm not particularly optimistic at this point. [%person#2-surname] has made his stance fairly clear
KEY-353501: I'm not reading too much into it and I don't really believe that [%person#2-first] actually doubts their chances
KEY-353502: I'm not reading too much into it and I don't really believe that [%person#2-first] actually doubts their title chances
KEY-353503: I'm not so sure he's even got a point. I think we've got a great chance
KEY-353504: I'm not so sure about that. Sometimes things don't go to plan or are affected by factors outside of anyone's control. It's rare that a pitch is bad by design
KEY-353505: I'm not sure about that, it could just as easily become a distraction
KEY-353506: I'm not sure it's going to be a great spectacle really; there are teams that will clearly survive and others which are definitely going down. It's going to be the same as it is every year
KEY-353507: I'm not sure it's going to be a great spectacle really; there's one team clearly better than the rest and everyone else, including us, will be chasing them
KEY-353508: I'm not sure it's the right move for the club or the player at this time. He might not even go out on loan; staying here could be the wisest choice
KEY-353509: I'm not sure they're going to see it out. Players can get very tense at this time of the season and I get the impression they're going to slip up
KEY-353510: I'm not sure they're really playing that well, they've not hit their stride properly yet and I'm questioning whether they even will
KEY-353511: I'm not sure why he got so uppity; I was asked a question and answered it honestly
KEY-353512: I'm not surprised he's kicked off in such a manner, it's most befitting of him and his team
KEY-353513: I'm not surprised [%person#2-surname] has kicked off, it deflects attention away from the questionable performance of his team
KEY-353514: I'm not unduly worried. We've got a lot of weapons in our arsenal
KEY-353516: I'm pleased for them and their supporters. Teams looking to improve will in turn enhance the quality of our league
KEY-353517: I'm pleased that he is able to recognise the fact we're a capable team. I think we stand a fair chance
KEY-353520: I'm positive we'll be able to find the time to discuss matters and hopefully reach an outcome suitable for everyone
KEY-353522: I'm remaining optimistic. Transfers are never simple, I know that and [%person#2-first] knows it as well. We'll see what the future brings
KEY-353523: I'm sure [%person#2-surname] and I will get to talk about things and whilst it won't be ideal, I won't rule anything out at this stage
KEY-353524: I'm sure people in football aren't surprised by [%person#2-surname] reaction, but I would imagine they're growing tired of him
KEY-353525: I'm sure there are better things to ask me
KEY-353526: I'm sure there's better things to ask me
KEY-353527: I'm sure we'll address the problem just as soon as we can, and everybody can then move on from this
KEY-353528: I'm surprised to hear him speak with such assured arrogance. I can guarantee his players will know they've been in a game
KEY-353529: I'm treating it as I would any other fixture at this stage
KEY-353530: I'm under no illusions that it will be a tough match regardless of [%person#2-surname] comments
KEY-353532: I'm very happy to have come away with a good result, the pitch made it difficult for both sides and I'm proud of the way my lads overcame the conditions
KEY-353533: I'm very surprised to hear that, I thought it was a very poor match today and the surface can shoulder a lot of the blame for that, it was a very disjointed affair and we shouldn't be putting up with pitches like that in this day and age
KEY-353535: I've certainly not thought about it that much
KEY-353538: I've got nothing to say on the matter and have more important things to be doing
KEY-353539: I've had quite a chuckle at his expense. That pitch cannot possibly be defended
KEY-353540: I've listened to and read much of the coverage of what is undoubtedly a big story and whilst there's a number of valid points being made, nobody has access to the information that I have, and that's why I know I did the right thing
KEY-353542: I've not been completely enamoured with some of the comments coming from their camp. It's left a bit of a sour taste and I'd love another crack at them
KEY-353543: I've recognised the issue, the club will fix things in due course. I can only apologise for the poor quality of the pitch and then focus my attentions on the next match
KEY-353544: I've seen a few of their games lately and the pitch is an absolute state at the minute, it's crazy that in this day and age we can't get a decent playing surface at this level, I think it's about time [%person#2-first] did something about it to be honest
KEY-353545: I've seen enough to think we've got a good chance of working things out
KEY-353546: I've seen far too many upsets to go into this match with any complacency. It'll be a tough game and we'll be prepared
KEY-353547: I've seen him make a handful of costly errors and I think we can look to expose him and take advantage of that
KEY-353548: I've worked on transfer deals with some very good friends and they're still a tough slog to finalise nine times out of ten
KEY-353549: My comments had good intentions but have apparently provoked a reaction, so I'm going to look upon their imminent and inevitable failures with glee
KEY-353550: My focus is solely on what we're going to do, not anything else outside of that
KEY-353551: My lads are more than capable of performing on any kind of surface, I don't see it as a concern at all and we're confident of getting a decent result
KEY-353552: My preference is to stay quiet, work hard, and devise ways to win on the pitch. Call me old school, but that's the way I choose to work
KEY-353555: You rejected [%team#2-short] offer for [%male#3]. Do you feel you can keep hold of him and ward off [%person#2] interest, or are you willing to sell?
KEY-353556: You're clearly a fan of the player; can we expect a transfer bid to be lodged in the near future?
KEY-353557: You've reportedly expressed an interest in [%team#2-short] [%male#3]; what more can you tell us about that?
KEY-353558: Your admission of interest in [%male#3] has led to some pundits discussing quite why you seem to favour [%team#2-short] players. Is there something in particular you see in those working under [%person#2]?
KEY-353559: Your bid for [%male#3] was rejected by [%team#2-short]. Are you confident of being able to pull the deal off with an improved offer?
KEY-353560: Your reported interest in [%team#2-short] [%male#3] falls into place well with an apparent strategy, having had the likes of [%person_list#1] amongst your squads in recent times. What is it you see in a player developed by [%person#2]?
KEY-353562: [%person#1-surname] has shown a fair preference for [%nation#1-nationality] talent during his time at [%team#1-short], with the majority of players signed on his watch being from or eligible for [%nation#1], with [%nation#2] featuring as well.
KEY-353563: [%person#1-surname] has shown a trust in [%nation#1-nationality] talent during his time at [%team#1-short]. Roughly half of his signings are from or eligible for [%nation#1], whilst [%nation#2] also features.
KEY-353565: He has his interpretation, I have [%person#2-mine]. The referee got it wrong this time but maybe we'll have better luck in the future
KEY-353570: He's clearly going to try to unsettle [%male#3-first], and when that happens I become relatively powerless. What can I do about it?
KEY-353574: He entitled to his opinion, but I'm not commenting on it
KEY-353575: His confidence is charming, but they're going to struggle. It'll be a good season to watch unfold for everyone though
KEY-353576: His focus is already slipping from what should actually matter. Instead of getting into arguments with me, he should be working out how to secure promotion. They're going to slip up, mark my words
KEY-353577: His focus is already slipping from what should actually matter. Instead of getting into arguments with me, he should be working out how to secure qualification. They're going to slip up, mark my words
KEY-353578: His focus is already slipping from what should actually matter. Instead of getting into arguments with me, he should be working out how to secure survival. They're going to slip up, mark my words
KEY-353579: His focus is already slipping from what should actually matter. Instead of getting into arguments with me, he should be working out how to win the title. They're going to slip up, mark my words
KEY-353581: [%person#2-first] can stick his oar in as often as he likes, it won't affect anything I do
KEY-353582: [%person#2-first] has my full backing should he want it. He in charge there and if he had to put [%male#3-surname] on the transfer list then I have to believe there are sufficient reasons for doing so
KEY-353583: [%person#2-first] has put together a handy team there and they're going to give us everything they've got. My boys will be prepared
KEY-353584: [%person#2-first] is always a pleasure to deal with and whilst it doesn't really matter if it helped smooth things out, I found it a very easy deal to agree upon
KEY-353585: [%person#2-first] is an excellent coach and developer of talent. It's a coincidence that I'm in for another of his players but I know I'll be getting a good player
KEY-353586: [%person#2-first] is just being polite; he knows that [%team#2-short] will probably win this comfortably
KEY-353587: [%person#2-first] is right, the surface wasn't great but to claim it had any kind of impact on the performance of either side would be disingenuous of us as managers.
KEY-353588: [%person#2-first] is trying to get in [%male#3-first] head and affect his performance. It's up to me to make sure that doesn't work
KEY-353589: [%person#2-first] is welcome to his opinions; I however have nothing to say
KEY-353590: [%person#2-first] knows he's up against it. It would be a great move for [%male#3-first] and I'm as determined as possible to make it happen
KEY-353591: [%person#2-first] knows how I think and I know where he'll be coming from here. It's a lot easier when we can both go into situations like this with a solid understanding
KEY-353592: [%person#2-first] knows how I work, and ideally that will make things smoother as negotiations continue
KEY-353593: [%person#2-first] should be the first to admit that they got lucky and if he doesn't then he'll go down in my estimation
KEY-353594: [%person#2-surname] and all of the other doubters can think whatever they like. I'll work as hard as anyone possibly could here and we'll see who ends up being right
KEY-353595: [%person#2-surname] has made something of a habit of speaking without thinking. That doesn't appear to have changed
KEY-353596: [%person#2-surname] is merely dragging things out for as long as he can to save face. It wouldn't be good for him to sell at the first offer would it? I'm confident we'll get our man
KEY-353597: [%person#2-surname] knows this game, he's simply playing the media to get the last few drops out of his squad
KEY-353598: [%person#2-surname] likes to run his mouth at every opportunity. This isn't news
KEY-353599: [%person#2-surname] might be happy with lower standards but I certainly am not. We were the more handicapped team by conditions today, there is no doubt of that
KEY-353600: [%person#2-surname] should talk about something which actually matters instead of deflecting the attention away from his team
KEY-353601: [%person#2-surname] still as laughable as ever. He'll finish the season with egg on his face
KEY-353602: [%person#2] had some choice words about the condition of the [%stadium#1] playing surface. Do you think it was a poor pitch to play on?
KEY-353603: [%person#2] had some interesting thoughts regarding the controversial penalty decision which went against your side. What are your thoughts on the situation?

KEY-353609: [%person#2] has claimed that your team's late goal against them was entirely undeserved. Do you agree with that?
KEY-353610: [%person#2] has continued to express at least a passing interest in the transfer-listed [%male#3]. Do you think [%team#2-short] interest is legitimate?
KEY-353611: [%person#2] has defended the state of the [%stadium#1] playing surface, claiming that both teams had the same playing conditions available to them and that no excuses could be made. Do you agree with him?
KEY-353612: [%person#2] has expressed a few worries about going up against one of his former players in [%male#3]. Is this something you can use to your advantage?

KEY-353642: [%person#2] has shown no signs of backing down over the [%male#3] story. Do you think that [%team#2-short] will really part company with the player?
KEY-353643: [%person#2] has spoken of the potential of an informal relationship developing between your club and his should [%male#3] join [%team#1-short] on loan and enjoy a successful time of things. Can you see that happening?

KEY-353712: [%team#2-short] have a lot of players who are very similar, and he just stands out a little more from the pack when I watch them play
KEY-353713: [%team#2-short] have done quite a few teams a fairly big favour by hiring him; they're going to go in the wrong direction for a while if they don't amend the decision
KEY-353714: [%team#2-short] [%person#2] spoke with excitement at the prospect of facing off against a club the stature of your team in reaction to the [%comp#1-short] draw. Are you looking forward to the clash?
KEY-353715: [%team#2-short] [%person#2] was rather complimentary about your team in reaction to the [%comp#1-short] draw and suggested that [%team#1-short] will be a tough nut to crack. How do you truly rate your chances?
KEY-353716: [%team#2-short] proposed trade with [%team#1-short] has been called off at the last minute due to [%team#1-short] not being able to free up enough funds to complete the deal.

KEY-353838: A good result for you out there against a side who you staunchly defended before the match. Do you think your comments had any impact on the match at all?
KEY-353839: A good result for you out there against a side who you were very vocal in your admiration of before the match. How do you think your comments might have impacted the result today?
KEY-353841: A good result for your side out there. How surprising was it for you given your vocal admiration of [%person#2] squad before the match?
KEY-353842: A good result out there for you. How does it feel coming against [%person#2] who it seems you have a good relationship with given the pre-match exchange between the two of you?
KEY-353843: A huge match for both sides on [%date#1-day] and [%person#2] seems to be under the impression that he is handling the occasion better than you. Would you say that's the case?
KEY-353844: A poor result for your side out there coming at the hands of someone you seem to be on good terms with given your pre-match comments. How do you think that exchange might have affected the result?
KEY-353845: A positive result for you today. Do you think [%person#2] was affected by your criticism of his playing style before the match and how much of an impact did it have on the performances of both sides?
KEY-353846: A result like that is always disappointing regardless of the magnitude of the match and this is no different. I hope we can react positively to it though and get back on track quickly
KEY-353847: A result like that is always disappointing regardless of the magnitude of the match and this is no different. I hope we can react positively to it though and get back on track quickly
KEY-353849: Absolutely, [%person#2-first] is showing that you don't need to spend a lot of money to take a team to the next level, they're doing very well indeed given their constraints and we'll need to be at our best to beat them
KEY-353850: Absolutely, [%person#2] seems to think he can get results with experience alone and I'm delighted to have put paid to that with our performance today
KEY-353851: Absolutely, [%person#2] seems to think he can get results without a good core of home-grown players and I'm delighted to have proved him wrong with our performance today
KEY-353852: Absolutely, [%person#2] seems to think he can get results without a good cross-section of footballing styles and influences in his squad and I'm delighted to have proved him wrong with our performance today
KEY-353853: Absolutely, [%person#2] seems to think he has some sort of golden generation on his hands and I'm delighted to have put paid to that with our performance today
KEY-353854: Absolutely, the result and performances of both sides show that I got under his skin, if he was as good a manager as people seem to insist he is he wouldn't have let a few harsh words affect him like they have
KEY-353855: All I know is that it's not the sort of thing you'd see at this club, we try to behave with a bit more class here. My advice to him would be to try to not let occasions like this get to him so much
KEY-353856: All I know is that we are desperate for a result in this match and if he thinks he can match our desire and commitment on [%date#1-day] he's got another thing coming
KEY-353857: All I know is that we are well up for this match and if he thinks he is feeling the pressure now, he's going to be feeling it a lot more after we beat them!
KEY-353858: All [%person#2-first] comments have done is whet my appetite for what should be an interesting tactical encounter and I'm really looking forward to it
KEY-353859: All of this speculation is only coming from outside sources at the minute, as far as I'm concerned the board have full confidence in me and I'm just focusing on the upcoming matches
KEY-353860: All that [%person#2] is doing is making sure we will be all the more fired up and ready for a better result next time around, we will remember this and use it to bounce back
KEY-353861: All that [%person#2] is doing is making sure we will be all the more fired up and ready for a better result next time around, we will remember this and use it to give our fans the bragging rights next time
KEY-353864: Another great result for you today and [%person#2] has added to the plaudits coming your way in the aftermath of the match. Are you starting to think this is the level of performance you can consider par for the course now?
KEY-353865: Are you concerned about [%person#2] attitude towards recent differences of opinion regarding [%team#2-short] playing style? He has said that he has no intention of changing approach
KEY-353866: As you have now won a Manager of the Year award, you have unlocked the International Management unlockable.
KEY-353867: As far as I'm concerned it's all just speculation anyway so I'm relieved [%person#2-first] didn't add any more fuel to that particular fire, the board have full confidence in me and I'm just focused on the upcoming matches
KEY-353868: As long as we don't let all this praise go to our heads then there's no reason why we can't maintain our current performance levels or even improve on them, we have to make sure we keep our feet on the ground in all of this though
KEY-353869: But the fact is that managers can often crack under the pressure, you seem to handle it pretty well, can the same be said of [%person#2]?
KEY-353870: But the fact is that the added weight of expectation from the fans in matches like this can sometimes cause managers to crack a bit, you seem to handle it pretty well, can the same be said of [%person#2]?
KEY-353871: Certainly, I bet [%person#2-first] is getting pretty sick of everybody talking about how badly they're doing and that showed in their performance today. They played like they had a point to prove and credit has to go to [%person#2-first] for turning things around
KEY-353873: Child Comp League Stage Index
KEY-353876: Complacency could be an issue given the way [%person#2] sets his teams out, we're confident we know how to play against his style of football but we need to make sure we don't think we've got it won before kick-off
KEY-353877: Definitely, I've been itching to put him back in his place for a while now and at full-time on [%date#1-day] he is going to be regretting making this personal
KEY-353878: Definitely, while there are benefits to having foreign talent available to you, nothing really matches the level of commitment and desire you get from domestic players and we could do with a bit more of that sometimes
KEY-353879: Definitely, you can have all the talent in the world available but without the experience to go alongside it you won't get very far and I certainly think my squad would benefit from some of the know-how that [%person#2-first] has at his disposal
KEY-353880: Definitely. As I said, there are a lot of benefits to having foreign talent available and I do think we should be looking further afield with additions to the squad if possible
KEY-353881: Despite being less than ideally stocked in the [%position#1-general] department, where the likes of [%person_list#1] might not be considered a strong enough group by some observers, [%team#1-short] have got on with the task at hand and have racked up a fine run of results in the process.
KEY-353882: Did you find [%person#2] comments about your foreign legion at all disrespectful when he spoke in his earlier press conference?
KEY-353883: Did you find [%person#2] comments about your home-grown talent at all disrespectful when he spoke in his earlier press conference?
KEY-353884: Did you find [%person#2] comments about your more experienced players at all disrespectful when he spoke in his earlier press conference?
KEY-353885: Did you find [%person#2] comments about your young side at all disrespectful when he spoke in his earlier press conference?
KEY-353886: Do you agree that this could be seen as a bit of a grudge match between [%person#2] and yourself given his comments about you after your last encounter?
KEY-353888: Do you agree with [%person#2] assessment that his pre-match criticism of your playing style backfired a bit?
KEY-353889: Do you feel vindicated in your faith in home-grown players after the criticism from [%person#2] before the match and his subsequent comments?
KEY-353890: Do you feel vindicated in your faith in the foreign imports in your squad after the criticism from [%person#2] before the match and his subsequent comments?
KEY-353891: Do you feel vindicated in your faith in the older members of your squad after the criticism from [%person#2] before the match and his subsequent comments?
KEY-353892: Do you feel vindicated in your faith in youth after the criticism from [%person#2] before the match and his subsequent comments?
KEY-353893: Do you feel vindicated in your pre-match criticism of [%person#2] given that things went in your favour out there today?
KEY-353894: Do you have any comments in reaction to [%person#2] suggestions that some of your call-ups have been questionable?
KEY-353898: Do you think you might be being a little unfair on [%person#2] by suggesting his current overachievement won't last?
KEY-353899: Do you think you might be being a little unfair on [%person#2] by suggesting his current underachievement is going to continue?
KEY-353902: Do you think your comments might be construed as a bit disrespectful to the board at [%team#2]. Ultimately if they feel [%person#2] is underperforming then it's their prerogative to address the issue surely?
KEY-353903: Do you think your pre-match defence of [%person#2] has come back to haunt you a little bit given the result today?
KEY-353904: Do you think your pre-match support of [%person#2] position might have all been in vain following that result. Surely he can't hold on for much longer now?
KEY-353909: Do you think the result shows that a reappraisal might be due of [%person#2] side? Is this the result they needed to end their underachieving run?
KEY-353912: Don't you think that's a bit harsh? They're surely a side that should be performing at a much higher level than they currently are, wouldn't you say?
KEY-353915: Don't you think the fans would want to see a bit more passion from their manager given what's at stake in the match? They might start thinking that [%person#2] has got more desire to win than you?
KEY-353917: Don't get me wrong, it's never nice to see a fellow professional under this kind of pressure especially someone like [%person#2-first] who I've got a lot of time for. Ultimately though, I'm in the business of winning football matches and preparing properly for [%date#1-day] is my main concern
KEY-353921: Everyone has heard of a bad loser but I think [%person#2-first] is showing that you can sometimes be a bad winner as well. You would hope for a bit more dignity from your opponents but I guess it's to be expected when your opponents are a small-time club like [%team#2]
KEY-353922: Everyone has heard of a bad loser but I think [%person#2-first] is showing that you can sometimes be a bad winner as well. You would hope for a bit more dignity from your opponents
KEY-353925: Gameplans often go out of the window in matches like this and it can all come down to who wants it more. In that sense our preparations might not even matter come kick-off which could be a bit of a concern
KEY-353926: Gameplans often go out of the window in matches like this and it can all come down to who wants it more. In that sense our preparations might not even matter come kick-off
KEY-353928: Given the importance of the upcoming match for the two teams, there is an incredible hunger from the [%team#1-short] fans to get a positive result. Does the added pressure, given what's at stake, affect you in your preparations at all?
KEY-353929: Have you found any of [%person#2] recent comments about what he perceives to be your current overachievement patronising at all? His praise has been interpreted by some as being a bit demeaning for your side
KEY-353930: He's one of many players I've been taking a longer look at with a view to seeing what they have to offer
KEY-353931: How do you expect your steadfast attitude towards continuing this policy to be received?
KEY-353935: How do you feel about [%person#2] assessment that there isn't an immediate end in sight to your current level of underachievement?
KEY-353937: How do you feel about [%person#2] support of your position at [%team#1] ahead of your match against him on [%date#1-day]?
KEY-353939: How do you think the pre-match exchange between [%person#2] and yourself affected the match and do you think he will be feeling like he has got one over on you?
KEY-353940: How do you think the pre-match exchange between [%person#2] and yourself affected the match and how pleased are you to have got one over on him now?
KEY-353941: How do you think the pre-match exchange between [%person#2] and yourself affected the match and how pleased are you to have got one over on him now?
KEY-353942: How do you think the pre-match exchange between [%person#2] and yourself affected the match and do you think he will be feeling like he has got one over on you?
KEY-353943: How many serious injuries is it going to take before everybody - league officials, managers and players - face up to their responsibilities?
KEY-353944: How much do you think the negative exchange between [%person#2] and yourself affected the result for you out there?
KEY-353945: How shocked are you with that result coming, as it did, against a buoyant [%person#2] who you were very vocal in your admiration of before the match?
KEY-353946: I think you're playing this down a bit, there must be a part of you that relishes the fact you've got one over on [%person#2] given his comments before the match?
KEY-353947: I think you're playing this down a bit, there must be a part of you that relishes the fact you've managed to handle the pressure better than [%person#2] given his comments before the match?
KEY-353948: I would invite [%person#2-surname] to do a better job in the same circumstances
KEY-353949: If he thinks I'm being harsh here then he should maybe jump before he's pushed as he obviously doesn't have the mental toughness needed to beat us and the result we inflict on him will be his last anyway
KEY-353950: If that's how he saw it then more power to him but as far as I'm concerned I've still got very little time for him and no amount of post-match grovelling is going to change that
KEY-353951: In light of the recent speculation about your position at [%team#1] [%person#2] has called for more patience from club owners when it comes to firing their managers. Is this a sentiment you echo given the precarious nature of your job at the minute?
KEY-353952: In light of the recent speculation about your position at [%team#1], [%person#2] has criticised some of your recent performances. How do you feel about his comments ahead of [%date#1-day] match?
KEY-353956: Is it fair to say your pre-match praise for [%person#2] overachievement has come back to haunt you a bit given the result out there today?
KEY-353957: Is it fair to say that you're perhaps a bit envious of the amount of experience that [%person#2-surname] has available to him?
KEY-353961: Is there not a danger of your comments breeding overconfidence amongst your squad? How will you avoid a complacent performance on [%date#1-day]?
KEY-353963: It all strikes me as a bit of attempted mind games from [%person#2-first]. I don't pay any attention to this kind of thing really
KEY-353965: It does feel a bit like he's giving us a bit of a pat on the head. I think he's being condescending really and we're ready to show him we've got to be taken seriously on [%date#1-day]
KEY-353967: It genuinely makes me laugh. What right does anybody have to tell me how to coach my team? We're not breaking any rules; we just happen to go against the grain and it rubs people up the wrong way
KEY-353968: It looks a bit like it doesn't it? I had long since forgotten about what I'd said after the last match but whatever it was has obviously upset [%person#2-first] hasn't it?!
KEY-353969: It looks like [%team#2] might have turned a corner against your side today. What impact do you think your pre-match criticism of [%person#2] may have had on the result?
KEY-353971: It means a lot to know that you are impressing your fellow professionals. [%person#2-first] is one of the good guys in football and I'll be looking forward to having a drink and a chat with him after the match regardless of the result
KEY-353972: It means a lot to know that you are impressing your fellow professionals. [%person#2-first] is one of the good guys in football and I'll be looking forward to having a drink and a chat with him after the match regardless of the rivalry between our clubs
KEY-353976: It sounds a bit like somebody is a bit jealous doesn't it! I'd be hurt if somebody I respect had said that but coming from him it doesn't bother me at all
KEY-353977: It sounds like you might be a bit envious of the amount of domestic talent that [%person#2] has available to him. Is that a fair assessment?
KEY-353978: It sounds like you might be a bit envious of the amount of foreign talent that [%person#2] has available to him. Is that a fair assessment?
KEY-353980: It sounds like you might be worried that [%person#2] is handling the pressure better than you?
KEY-353981: It sounds like sour grapes to me I have to admit. We keep hearing how it must be our opponents at fault as if they've got some divine right to beat us but we're taking great joy in confounding expectations and will continue to do so
KEY-353982: It sounds like sour grapes to me I have to admit. We were excellent today and sometimes it's hard for a manager to accept that they were second best on the day
KEY-353983: It was always going to be tough against [%person#2]'s side as they play such good football so I can't say I'm too surprised with the result. I just hope my lads can take some valuable experience from the match to narrow that gulf in quality next time around
KEY-353984: It was always going to be tough against the squad that [%person#2-first] has put together so I can't say I'm too surprised with the result. I just hope my lads can take some valuable experience from the match to narrow that gulf in quality next time around
KEY-353985: It was no surprise to me that [%person#2-surname] would resort to underhand tactics and mind games like that, it's even less surprising that it backfired like it did though, his unprofessionalism is only outweighed by his incompetence
KEY-353986: It would have been nice if he'd stuck up for me a bit if I'm honest, this can be a very tough business to deal with sometimes and I feel that we as managers should stick together where possible
KEY-353988: It wouldn't surprise me if he felt that way, he seems much more focused on what I'm doing than on his own team sometimes. I find it a bit petty and unprofessional to be honest and symptomatic of the culture at that club
KEY-353989: It wouldn't surprise me if he felt that way, he seems much more focused on what I'm doing than on his own team sometimes. I find it a bit petty and unprofessional to be honest
KEY-353990: It's my job to get the best out of the tools at my disposal. This is the way in which I felt it most appropriate to play
KEY-353992: It's a shame to see a fellow professional acting this way frankly, he needs to stop mouthing off in the press and start worrying about his team
KEY-353993: It's a shame to see a fellow professional acting this way frankly, he needs to stop mouthing off in the press and start worrying about his team
KEY-353995: It's all very admirable trying to give youth a chance like [%person#2-first] but at some point he has to realise that he needs a balance of youth and experience and we're ready to teach him that lesson on [%date#1-day]
KEY-353996: It's always difficult when you're facing somebody as talented as [%person#2-first] but I'm still disappointed with the result, I'd be in the wrong job if I admitted defeat as easily as that
KEY-353997: It's always flattering to hear nice things being said but I try not to let it affect me. The moment anyone thinks they're the finished article is the moment they start to decline as a manager
KEY-353998: It's always flattering to hear someone speak positively about you, I just hope we can get a win on [%date#1-day] so the plaudits can continue!
KEY-353999: It's always flattering to hear someone speak positively about you, especially when it comes from a fierce rival like this. Let's just see if the plaudits continue if we can get a win on [%date#1-day] though!
KEY-354000: It's always hard to accept bids for players of [%male#3-first] quality but if he goes, I'm delighted he'll be going to a great club and to work under a top manager in [%person#2-first]
KEY-354002: It's always nice to feel like you're having an influence on someone and I'm flattered to hear that [%person#2-first] thinks that of me
KEY-354003: It's always nice to hear positive things being said about you but I try not to get carried away, we've got a big match to focus on against [%person#2-first] side and I'm sure it will be a great occasion
KEY-354004: It's always nice to receive praise but I'd certainly prefer to receive a victory at the final whistle on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354005: It's always nice to receive praise from a fellow professional, especially someone like [%person#2-first] who I have a lot of time for, hopefully we can continue to exceed expectations and get a good result against him though
KEY-354006: It's always nice to receive support from a fellow professional, especially someone like [%person#2-first] who I have a lot of time for, hopefully we can prove him right with a good result against him on [%date#1-day] though
KEY-354007: It's answering questions like this which created this whole situation in the first place so I'm not going to be commenting about [%person#2] or anything other than football in this press conference
KEY-354008: It's becoming increasingly difficult to manage expectations I've got to admit, keeping the lads' feet on the ground is getting harder and harder with every good result and it is starting to become a worry
KEY-354009: It's certainly given this match an extra edge, I think it's clear to everyone that [%person#2-first] and I are that bit more driven to get a result given the personal issues between the two of us
KEY-354012: It's difficult not to see it like that when you're dealing with someone like [%person#2], his comments after our last match have given us plenty of fuel to go out there and beat him
KEY-354013: It's difficult to disagree with him unfortunately, we're really lacking in confidence at the minute and might struggle to turn it around, I just hope we can pull ourselves together for a good result against [%person#2-surname] now though, his comments would make it all the sweeter
KEY-354014: It's difficult to disagree with him unfortunately, we've done amazingly well to be in this position but the harsh reality is that it's probably not something we can sustain for much longer, I just hope we can get a good result against [%person#2-surname] now though, his comments would make it all the sweeter
KEY-354016: It's great to hear that somebody thinks you're doing a good job and it's even better when coming from someone I admire like [%person#2-first]
KEY-354017: It's hard to ignore it and there are times where it's clearly affecting my players. If that persists, then perhaps we'll have to look at potential changes
KEY-354018: It's no less than I expected from someone like him to be honest. Unfortunately in any walk of life you have to deal with people like him sometimes and football is no different. I have very little time for him
KEY-354020: It's not my job to show solidarity with other managers, this is a very ruthless industry that we're in and people are going to lose their jobs on a regular basis. It's not something for me to lose any sleep over though and I'm sure if the positions were reversed that he would say the same about me
KEY-354021: It's not about vindication, it's about getting results and I'm very pleased with how things went today, the boys put in a performance I knew they were capable of against a very good [%team#2] side and we can move on now with a renewed confidence
KEY-354022: It's not always possible for players to perform different tasks every week so I have to make sure that everyone knows their role and is comfortable performing it, that's not stubbornness it's pragmatism
KEY-354023: It's simply a case of it being the most natural fit for the personnel in the squad
KEY-354024: It's surprising to see you failing to show support for another manager like this. Could your reluctance to comment on the issue be interpreted as a failure to show solidarity with a fellow professional?
KEY-354025: It's unusual to hear a manager praising an opponent like this before a match. Do you think your comments could be seen as a bit of an inferiority complex?
KEY-354026: It's unusual to hear a manager praising an opponent like this before a match. Do you think your positivity could be seen as a bit of an inferiority complex?
KEY-354027: It's unusual to hear a manager speak so negatively about an opponent like this, is there a danger of you becoming too preoccupied with the personal rivalry between the two of you?
KEY-354028: It's unusual to hear a manager speak so negatively about an opponent like this, is there a danger the rivalry between the two clubs has turned into a personal rivalry between the two of you?
KEY-354029: It's unusual to hear a manager speaking so candidly. Do you think you're showing a lack of respect for [%person#2] and his playing style?
KEY-354030: It's unusual to see a manager admitting to nerves quite so frankly; is there a chance that this negativity about your chances on [%date#1-day] could affect your side's performance?
KEY-354031: It's very dull to see a side sit ten men behind the ball and let you struggle to break them down but that's what we'll have to do. [%person#2-first] has to do what he can to get a result and if he doesn't have the confidence in his strikers to do the job for him this is what happens
KEY-354033: It's very flattering, we're really enjoying our football at the minute and hope it can continue, I know that [%person#2-first] will give us a tough game but we're hoping we can ride this wave of success for a while longer yet
KEY-354034: It's very reassuring to hear someone speak so positively about you and I'm very appreciative of [%person#2-first] comments, we know we'll be in for a tough match from his side but hopefully we can get a good result and start turning things around here
KEY-354035: It's very unusual to hear a manager being so harsh about a fellow professional when they're under pressure like this. Do you not think you're being unduly harsh on [%person#2] here?
KEY-354036: It's water off a duck's back. I'm not bothered by it and more importantly, neither are the players
KEY-354037: Just about yes but I was very impressed with the performance of his side, they showed a lot more commitment and desire than I was expecting and made life very difficult for us at times
KEY-354038: Just about yes but I was very impressed with the performance of his side, they showed they know all the tricks-of-the-trade and made life very difficult for us with their experience
KEY-354040: Let's just say it means more coming from some managers than others, I have very little respect for [%person#2] or his club and I can't wait to beat them on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354041: Let's just say it means more coming from some managers than others. [%person#2-first] is not someone I have a lot of time for in all honesty so I'm looking forward to beating him on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354042: Like I said, I'm not a big fan of [%person#2-first] playing style so by the same token I'm not too worried about any performance he might be able to conjure up
KEY-354043: Like I said, my only interest is in getting a good result on [%date#1-day], nothing else comes into it for me
KEY-354046: Look, at the end of the day I've said I don't think he should be sacked, ultimately though if we get the result I know we can against his side on [%date#1-day] it might just be the final nail in the coffin for him unfortunately
KEY-354047: Many people would say that this war of words has damaged your reputations and that of your respective clubs as well, is that something you're worried about?
KEY-354048: Maybe I am but this is a harsh business, I've got no personal problem with [%person#2-first] or anything like that but the fact of the matter is we wouldn't even be having this discussion if he was performing better in his role
KEY-354049: Maybe, it's just my prediction though, I think eventually someone, hopefully us, will get wise to them and they'll fade away a bit, that's not to belittle what has been a fantastic run so far though
KEY-354050: Maybe, yes. I was disappointed with [%person#2] behaviour before the match and there is always a difficulty in allowing your emotions to cloud your judgement when it comes to football, it's something we'll look to avoid in future
KEY-354055: No, I wouldn't say that, every manager has their own methods and preferences when it comes to squad balance and I'm very happy with the talent I have at my disposal
KEY-354058: Not a chance, respect is something which has to be earned and then maintained. I think some of [%person#2-surname] players are getting to the stage where they're starting to lose respect by not knowing when to call it quits
KEY-354059: Not at all, I go into every match confident of a result regardless of the opposition and this is no different. [%person#2-first] is obviously a fantastic manager as his recent success shows but we still felt we could get something from this match
KEY-354060: Not at all, I go into every match thinking we can get a good result. If I'm honest, I was hoping my comments would make [%person#2-first] and his players a bit complacent but unfortunately that wasn't the case
KEY-354061: Not at all, I had a drink with [%person#2-first] after the match as I would with anyone else. The match was decided on the pitch, not with what either of us said in the build-up
KEY-354063: Not at all, I just don't think [%person#2-surname] is capable of dragging them out of the doldrums, we'll beat them on [%date#1-day] and make his job that much harder as well
KEY-354064: Not at all, I just don't think [%person#2-surname] is capable of sustaining a run like this and we'll be looking to put an end to it on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354065: Not at all, I think I'm a very forward-thinking manager in this regard and it infuriates me that an old fashioned refusal to embrace new ideas and styles can be seen as a positive thing in some way
KEY-354066: Not at all, I think nerves are only natural in games like this even for very talented managers like [%person#2-first] and myself, I'm just hoping that he is struggling with them as well
KEY-354067: Not at all, I think nerves are only natural in games like this even for very talented managers like [%person#2-first] and myself. I'm just hoping that I can cope better on the day
KEY-354068: Not at all, I think the fact that he is a good manager with a great set of players is what turned things in his favour, not anything he said in the build-up
KEY-354069: Not at all, I took his comments in the complimentary way they were intended, I'd disagree that we are overachieving though, I've got a very talented bunch of players here and I'm confident they can maintain this level of performance for a long time yet
KEY-354070: Not at all, I'm confident that we can beat [%person#2] side given the style of football he insists on playing, no amount of complacency could change that
KEY-354071: Not at all, I'm very passionate about the need for home-grown players in this country and I think people like [%person#2] are damaging to the game as a whole here as a result of their reliance on foreigners
KEY-354072: Not at all, my appreciation of his playing style isn't a resignation of defeat, I have every confidence that my players can match his and get a good result
KEY-354073: Not at all, [%person#2-first] and I had a chat after the game and it was clear that there were no hard feelings at all. I don't think anything more needs to be said about it to be honest
KEY-354074: Not at all, [%person#2-first] and I had a good chat after the game and there were no issues between the two of us as far as I'm concerned
KEY-354075: Not at all, [%person#2-first] has been very magnanimous with his comments and as far as I'm concerned any personal issues between the two of us are long gone now
KEY-354076: Not at all, [%person#2-first] is lucky to have such a talented group of young players but I'm just as lucky to have the squad that I've got available to me. It just means the fans should be in for a great match on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354077: Not at all, [%person#2-first] is lucky to have such a wealth of experience in his squad but I'm just as lucky to have the talent that I've got available to me, it just means the fans should be in for a great match on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354078: Not at all, [%person#2-first] is lucky to have such an abundance of talented home-grown players in his squad but I'm just as lucky to have the talent that I've got available to me, it just means the fans should be in for a great match on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354079: Not at all, his comments have been like water off a duck's back to me. My advice to him would be to try to not let the pressure get to him so much
KEY-354080: Not at all, [%person#2-surname] just got lucky today as he did with his recent success, he caught us on an off day and next time around he won't be so fortunate
KEY-354081: Not at all, [%person#2] will think the result has vindicated his mind games in the build-up but I think he has handled [%person#2-himself] pretty unprofessionally in the past few days. It speaks volumes about the lack of class from him and his club
KEY-354082: Not at all, [%person#2] will think the result has vindicated his mind games in the build-up but I think he has handled [%person#2-himself] pretty unprofessionally in the past few days
KEY-354083: Not at all, it might not be what the fans want to hear but me and [%person#2-first] had a good chat after the game and there were no issues between the two of us as far as I'm concerned
KEY-354086: Not at all, we didn't get the result we wanted out there but the pre-match exchange was blown out of all proportion and had nothing to do with the match itself. I spoke to [%person#2-first] after the match and there is no animosity between the two of us
KEY-354087: Not at all, we're in this position by taking each game as it comes and ignoring all of the talk about us and one poor performance doesn't change that, if anything it will do us a favour and help us remain grounded
KEY-354088: Not at all. [%person#2-first] is lucky to have such an abundance of talented foreign players in his squad but I'm just as lucky to have the talent that I've got available to me, it just means the fans should be in for a great match on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354089: Not at all. [%person#2-first] might be thinking that but it's none of my concern. I'm calm and focused on the match ahead
KEY-354090: Not really, no. I'm trying not to treat this match differently to any other. Whatever [%person#2-first] said or says won't affect our preparation
KEY-354091: Obviously the deal had to be right financially but mulling things over with [%person#2-first] certainly made it easier to come to an agreement
KEY-354092: Of course he can't go on indefinitely with this run of poor results but I still think it's too soon to be talking about sacking him
KEY-354093: Of course it is, I just think that history has shown us that patience is rewarded when it comes to managerial changes, [%person#2-first] will come good given a bit more time I'm sure of that
KEY-354094: Of course it won't be acceptable. Whether that means someone has to instigate change I don't know, but it's certainly worthy of discussion
KEY-354095: Oh do me a favour! They're going to need a thick skin if they want to succeed in this sport and if what I've just said actually gets to them then we're in for an easier game on [%date#1-day] than I imagined
KEY-354096: Oh of course, that's not what I was trying to say, they are absolutely there on merit, you can only beat what's in front of you after all. I just think that other sides have been guilty of underestimating them that's all, it's something we'll have to avoid
KEY-354097: On paper maybe they are, but football matches aren't won and lost on paper, they're won and lost on the pitch and they currently don't look like they belong in the bracket that many seem to think they're in. That's not a dig at [%person#2-first] by any means, he's doing fine
KEY-354100: Perhaps so, I apologise if that's how it came across as that's not what I was intending, I'm sure the decision makers at [%team#2] will do what's best for the club either way
KEY-354101: Perhaps they did, yes. I can't pretend that hearing him point out the faults in my tactics didn't tempt me to change things a bit but the result shows I should have had more confidence in my methods
KEY-354102: Re-elected [%job#1] [%person#2] has thanked you for your patience during what has undoubtedly been a stressful time for those involved with the club.
KEY-354104: Results have obviously been poor for them for a while now but I think the absence of anyone else out there who could do a better job is what goes in [%person#2-surname] favour, the board at [%team#2] need to have an upgrade in mind if they want to change managers and I can't think of anyone that would fit the bill
KEY-354105: Sit Narrower is designed to set the team up to play in the central areas of the pitch, either to exploit a weakness in the opposition or to consolidate defensively in a bid to keep the opposing threats on the periphery.
KEY-354107: So much gets said in the press these days that it's difficult to take anything at face value. It wouldn't surprise me at all if [%person#2-first] was just trying to play mind games with me, particularly given the strength of feeling between the two sets of fans
KEY-354108: Some people call it experience, I prefer to call it age. We have the advantage over them in terms of fitness and physicality and we can be very confident of a positive result on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354110: Speaking in his press conference, [%person#2] seemed somewhat envious of the abundance of foreign talent you have in your squad. How surprised were you to hear an opponent expressing such a view and does it give you extra confidence for the match?
KEY-354111: Speaking in his press conference, [%person#2] seemed somewhat envious of the abundance of home-grown talent you have in your squad. How surprised were you to hear an opponent expressing such a view and does it give you extra confidence for the match?
KEY-354112: Speaking in his press conference, [%person#2] seemed somewhat envious of the wealth of experience you have in your squad. How surprised were you to hear an opponent expressing such a view and does it give you extra confidence for the match?
KEY-354113: Speaking in his press conference, [%person#2] seemed somewhat envious of the young talent you have in your squad. How surprised were you to hear an opponent expressing such a view and does it give you extra confidence for the match?
KEY-354114: Suggestions and constructive feedback are always appreciated and I have time for every manager's opinions. All options will be considered, but patience is required
KEY-354115: Surely there will come a point where the line has to be drawn? It can't be acceptable to see players injured, even if it's not to a serious extent, as a result of over-enthusiastic play
KEY-354116: Teams between [%number#1-nth] and [%number#2-nth] places are sorted separately in the [%stage_name#1 - e.g. 2nd placed teams table)] table
KEY-354118: That is all in the past now as far as I'm concerned, we both let things get a bit out of hand and I'm looking forward to a chance to set things straight with him after what will hopefully be a good match
KEY-354119: That is rich coming from him, he tried to get involved in all this mind-game nonsense and has suddenly decided to take offence to it and now he is lashing out at me. It says it all about him frankly
KEY-354120: That says it all about his ego really doesn't it? [%person#2] is capable of breath-taking arrogance sometimes and the idea that his comments had any bearing on the result just shows how deluded he is
KEY-354121: That's a very surprising response, are you just showing a bit of jealousy here or is your criticism of [%person#2] actually justified in your eyes?
KEY-354122: That's all well and good but do you think that [%person#2] even has any interest in burying the hatchet here? How confident are you that he'll be able to put this behind him?
KEY-354125: The club noted though that there was a sharp increase in non-football costs which it attributed to costs associated with the club's recent promotion.
KEY-354126: The club noted though that there was a sharp increase in non-football costs which it attributed to restructuring costs associated with the club's recent good financial performance.
KEY-354127: The club noted though that there was a sharp increase in non-football costs which it attributed to restructuring costs associated with the growth in the club's profile.
KEY-354128: The defeat hurts all the more given it was at the hands of [%person#2] and his tin-pot club, his comments about me before the match were typically small time and I can't wait to get a bit of revenge on him next time around
KEY-354130: The difficulty in all of this is managing expectations, keeping the lads' feet on the ground is getting harder and harder with every good result and I just hope we're not setting ourselves up for a fall with these good results
KEY-354131: The extra pressure doesn't come into consideration for me, at the end of the day it's just one fixture in a much bigger picture
KEY-354133: The fact that he is trying to backtrack now says everything you need to know about him. He has been utterly unprofessional and I'm not at all interested in trying to get in his good books
KEY-354134: The fans are less than happy with [%male#2] since signing. Are you confident that he can assuage the doubters and come good?
KEY-354135: The fans might not like this much but I had a chat with [%person#2-first] after the match and set a few things straight between the two of us, there's no problem between us as far as I'm concerned
KEY-354136: The fans want to see a victory, they don't care about how much their manager says in the press, [%person#2] may well be one of those guys who has to overcompensate in his pre-match comments but I'm not one of them
KEY-354139: The game has come on a lot since the days when we were suspicious of foreign imports and I for one am very pleased about that. It's great to see the influence of other countries' styles and cultures on our game and [%person#2-first] will be a tough opponent on [%date#1-day] as a result
KEY-354140: The importance of this match speaks for itself and I was surprised to hear [%person#2] speaking so negatively about it, a win means so much more than just three points to these fans and I'm pretty sure the [%team#2] fans will be pretty dismayed by his remarks
KEY-354141: The importance of this match speaks for itself and I was surprised to hear [%person#2] speaking so negatively about it, a win means so much more than just three points
KEY-354142: The longer this goes on the harder it's going to be when we eventually come unstuck, it's going to happen at some point and my main job at the minute is making sure we don't hit a downward spiral when it does
KEY-354143: The relationship between [%person#2] and yourself shows no signs of improving with his latest comments seeming to show no desire at all to put an end to the feud. What is it about the two of you that causes these fireworks every time you face each other?
KEY-354144: The result certainly feels all the sweeter given how he tried to get under my skin before the match, it's a great feeling knowing that he's suffering now along with their supporters, bragging rights are everything in these matches
KEY-354145: The result certainly feels all the sweeter given how he tried to get under my skin before the match. It's a great feeling knowing that he's suffering now
KEY-354146: The result has made things harder for sure but we have to try and stay positive about our chances, the moment we accept that we can't turn things around is the moment I'm finished as a football manager
KEY-354147: The result is the most important thing, I thought [%person#2-first] was a tough opponent today and I'm pleased to have got the result against someone I have a lot of time for
KEY-354148: The result stings that bit more given it was inflicted on us by [%person#2] and his side. We can't wait to get our own back on him next time around
KEY-354149: The result stings that bit more given it was inflicted on us by [%person#2]. We can't wait to get our own back on him next time around
KEY-354151: The thing about [%person#2] is that his sides always try and walk the ball in, I'm confident we can defend against them easily enough and look to hurt them when we have possession back
KEY-354152: The thing with a lot of foreign players is that you have to question their commitment to their clubs when compared to the home-grown lads. I think [%person#2-surname] might have a job on his hands to get the best out of a squad like that
KEY-354153: The upcoming match sees you locking horns with [%person#2] again. How keen are you to get the win given your very public war of words with him last time around?
KEY-354154: The whole thing is utterly absurd, I thought I had shaken his hand but frankly I had more important things to think about after the match. It's possible I inadvertently missed him and I apologise if I've hurt his feelings in any way
KEY-354155: There are no hard feelings at all between [%person#2-first] and myself, the match wasn't affected by any of his comments as far as I'm concerned, the occasion and feeling between the two clubs was all the motivation we needed
KEY-354156: There are no hard feelings at all between [%person#2-first] and myself, the match wasn't affected by any of his comments as far as I'm concerned
KEY-354157: There has to be a crackdown on unnecessarily aggressive football. We have to protect our players and allow them to thrive in an environment which encourages exciting play
KEY-354158: There is no personal battle. [%person#2-first] is someone I have a lot of respect for, the media is trying to stir up a confrontation which is just not there as far as I'm concerned
KEY-354159: There might be a bit of an edge but I think you lot are playing it up a bit really, there are no hard feelings as far as I'm concerned but I'm confident of a positive result
KEY-354160: There was no need for him to say anything, this speculation is all a result of the likes of you lot drumming up a story anyway so I'm not surprised he had nothing to say about it
KEY-354161: There's a real danger of that yes, we've had fantastic momentum up until this point and this result might have knocked the wind out of our sails a bit, my job now is to try and ensure we don't hit a downward spiral but it won't be easy
KEY-354162: There's always a danger of letting your emotions cloud your judgement in any game of football, there are a lot of different factors to the match on [%date#1-day] but I'm a professional and it's my job to make sure that I don't let my personal feelings get the better of me
KEY-354163: There's always a danger of letting your emotions cloud your judgement in any game of football. I'm a professional and it's my job to make sure that doesn't happen on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354164: There's been no indication from the board that I'm under any sort of pressure so I'm not sure why [%person#2-first] keeps talking about it really, it doesn't bother me though I'm just focused on bouncing back from this result
KEY-354165: These big matches can often be pretty cagey affairs and I think the added weight of expectation is something to do with that, we'll both be looking to handle the nerves and hope our performances aren't affected too much
KEY-354166: They look more like a bunch of individuals than a team though, don't they? This is a fantastic time to play them and I'm pretty confident we can get a good result on [%date#1-day], they look devoid of confidence and [%person#2] is not turning things around any time soon as far as I'm concerned
KEY-354167: They really look devoid of any confidence at all at the minute, don't they? This is a fantastic time to play them and I'm pretty confident we can get a good result on [%date#1-day], [%person#2] is not turning things around any time soon as far as I'm concerned
KEY-354169: Things didn't go your way out there against a manager whose position at [%team#2] you defended before the match. Do you think [%person#2] will live to fight another day following that result?
KEY-354170: Things didn't go your way out there against a side who you had criticised for having too many domestic players before the match. Is it fair to say your comments backfired a bit?
KEY-354171: Things didn't go your way out there against a side who you had criticised for having too many foreign players before the match. Is it fair to say your comments backfired a bit?
KEY-354172: Things didn't go your way out there against a side who you had written off as too old before the match. Is it fair to say your comments backfired a bit?
KEY-354173: Things didn't go your way out there against a side whose inexperience you had criticised before the match. Is it fair to say your comments backfired a bit?
KEY-354174: Things didn't go your way out there, were you expecting that given your praise of [%person#2] before the match?
KEY-354175: Things finally went in your favour out there today. What impact would you say [%person#2] comments about your underachievement had on the result?
KEY-354176: This has been an absolute disaster for us and I'm really not enjoying life at the club currently, our heads have gone and as much as I'd like to think I can turn things around I'm really not confident
KEY-354177: This result must hurt all the more given the gloating that [%person#2] has been partaking in since the final whistle. How do you intend to handle the big match better next time around?
KEY-354178: This result must hurt all the more given the gloating that [%person#2] has been partaking in since the final whistle. How do you intend to handle the pressure better next time around?
KEY-354179: This will probably sound like sour grapes but I don't really think [%person#2-surname] deserves this success. There are plenty of better managers than him out there who are more deserving of this kind of achievement and I'm hoping a good result against [%team#2] on [%date#1-day] will show the football world that I'm better than him
KEY-354183: Unfortunately I'm starting to think he might be right, it's no secret that I'm under a lot of pressure here at the minute and even with today's result I have to admit I'm struggling to deal with it
KEY-354184: Unfortunately in any walk of life you have to deal with people like him sometimes and football is no different, I have very little time for him though and his behaviour speaks volumes about the way that club goes about its business
KEY-354185: Unfortunately, [%person#2-first] has a point. Our performances haven't been good enough and the team have put me in a position where I'm now having to put up with a whole lot of speculation about my job, the lads have got us into this mess and I'm expecting them to get us out of it as well
KEY-354187: We appreciate this is your first job and are taking that into consideration, but we want to know what you plan to do to turn the team's performance around?
KEY-354188: We approached the match as we would approach any other game, getting a good result was the most important thing and we're very pleased with the result
KEY-354191: We can take some positives from the match and the performance but we didn't get the result we wanted and in an important match like this it's tough to swallow, hopefully we can bounce back quickly
KEY-354192: We can take some positives from the match and the performance but we didn't get the result we wanted and in an important match like this it's tough to swallow, hopefully we can bounce back quickly
KEY-354194: We tried to play the match rather than the occasion, getting a good result was the important thing and we're very pleased with the way things went out there
KEY-354197: We will be focused on our own game as always, I prefer to focus on the strengths of my side than the perceived weaknesses of the opposition
KEY-354200: We'll see, won't we? I'm more than confident we can show them up on [%date#1-day] and prove they've got no divine right to be any better off than they are
KEY-354201: We'll see, won't we? I'm more than confident we can show them up on [%date#1-day] and put a stop to all this nauseating fawning
KEY-354202: We've got in this position by taking each game as it comes and nothing has changed there, we'll continue to play each match with the right levels of application and commitment and see where we end up
KEY-354203: Well I can't sit here and say that I handled it well given the result, football is one big learning curve though so [%person#2-first] shouldn't get too cocky, he might find [%person#2-himself] on the receiving end next time
KEY-354204: Were you half expecting the result to go against you like that given how highly you spoke about [%person#2] side before the match?
KEY-354205: Were you surprised to hear [%person#2] admission that his [%team#2-short] side may sometimes go too far and that changes may be in the offing?
KEY-354206: What [%person#2-first] has said isn't important, I'd much rather focus on the football, we've got a good result and that's all I'm concerned about
KEY-354207: What a daft question, there is no way that he has more desire to win than me. I want to win this match badly but it will still only be worth the same as any other game
KEY-354208: What a daft question, there is no way that he has more desire to win than me. I want to win this match badly but it will still only be worth three points like any other game
KEY-354209: What do you make of [%person#2] attempts to cool the war of words between the two of you since the match? Do they hold much sway given the feelings between the two clubs?
KEY-354210: What do you make of [%person#2] attempts to cool the war of words between the two of you since the match?
KEY-354213: What makes you consider [%male#3-surname] to be [%team#2-short] weak point?
KEY-354214: What was the thinking behind adopting such a style in the first place?
KEY-354215: What would you do to change the situation? Do you think there should be sterner punishments for these types of transgressions?
KEY-354216: Whilst I appreciate [%person#2-first] support I'd like to distance myself from his criticism of the board here. I've never had any problems with them at all and hope to keep that the case
KEY-354217: Whilst I obviously hope we get a good result on [%date#1-day], I think the board at [%team#2] would be mad to sack [%person#2-first] regardless of the result. He's a very talented manager who just happens to be going through a tough run of fixtures at the minute
KEY-354218: Whilst it's always nice to receive praise, it would mean more coming from somebody I admired a bit more than [%person#2-surname] if I'm honest
KEY-354219: Whilst it's nice to receive his support, as far as I'm concerned it's all just speculation anyway, the board have full confidence in me and I'm just focused on the upcoming matches
KEY-354220: Whist I'm obviously disappointed with the result from our point of view, I'm delighted for [%person#2-first] and hope the board at [%team#2] sit up and take notice of what a talented manager they have now
KEY-354221: Who says I'm not up for the fight? Just because I'm keeping things professional doesn't mean I'm not desperate to beat [%person#2] on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354222: Why would I waste my breath supporting someone who doesn't deserve to be supported? [%person#2] is in this position because he isn't doing as well as he should be
KEY-354223: With current [%job#1] [%person#1] deciding against [%number#1-nth_text] term, [%person_list#1] are the candidates seeking to replace him.
KEY-354224: With current [%job#1] [%person#1] looking for [%number#1-nth_text] term, [%person_list#1] are the candidates seeking to replace him.
KEY-354225: With current [%job#1] [%person#1] unable to opt for [%number#1-nth_text] term, [%person_list#1] are the candidates seeking to replace him.
KEY-354226: Without a doubt, [%person#2-surname] only succeeded in firing us up, he essentially gave my team-talk for me and the players were all very keen to put him in his place
KEY-354227: Would you say this result proves you right in your pre-match assertions about [%person#2] side being a bit too old to compete these days?
KEY-354228: Would you say this result proves you right in your pre-match assertions about [%person#2] side having too many foreign players?
KEY-354229: Would you say this result proves you right in your pre-match assertions about [%person#2] side having too much of a reliance on domestic players?
KEY-354230: You could say that I guess, every manager wants to have talented players and I'm no different. The fact that [%person#2-first] has managed to combine that talent with a good core of home-grown players is something to be admired
KEY-354231: You could say that I guess, there are one or two youngsters that [%person#2-first] can call upon who I'd love to have available to me
KEY-354232: You could say that I guess, there's a lot of know-how in his squad that [%person#2-first] can call upon and I'd love to have that available to me
KEY-354233: You could say that I guess, there's a lot of positives to having a diverse squad in terms of the different influences and styles which can be called upon. [%person#2-First] is lucky to have that available to him and it's certainly something I'd like to benefit from as well
KEY-354234: You shouldn't confuse my professionalism for a lack of passion, I was desperate to get something from that match I just don't have to mouth off in the press like [%person#2] to show that
KEY-354235: You shouldn't confuse my professionalism for a lack of passion. I was desperate to get something from that match I just don't have to mouth off in the press like [%person#2] to show that, we try to behave with a bit more class at this club and our fans can take heart from that despite the result
KEY-354236: You're putting words in my mouth a bit there, just because I'm being complimentary doesn't mean I'm envious
KEY-354237: You're right, [%person#2-first] and I do get on and I like to see him doing well but not when it is at the expense of my side and I'm not happy with the result out there
KEY-354238: You're right, [%person#2-first] and I do get on and I like to see him doing well but ultimately my main focus is on my side and I'm very happy with the result out there
KEY-354240: [%date#1-day] match sees you come up against an increasingly under-pressure [%person#2], who is looking less secure in his role at [%team#2] by the day. Ahead of the match, How do you feel about your opposite number's chances of keeping his job?
KEY-354241: [%date#1-day] match will see you coming up against a [%team#2] side who have been gaining a lot of plaudits for their quick passing game. What do you think of the style of football [%person#2] has got them playing?
KEY-354242: [%job#1] [%person#4] has informed you that [%male#3] has been given an acceptable amount of first team action since you discussed his lack of appearances during his loan spell with [%team#1] and [%person#1].
KEY-354246: [%male#1-surname] performance as [%position#1-short]
KEY-354249: [%male#3] continued his encouraging return from injury but it was the performance of [%male#2] that stood out.
KEY-354250: [%male#3] was an unfortunate casualty against [%team#2-short] team many have claimed play too close to the edge and often cross the line of what might be considered acceptable physicality. What do you make of their style and approach?
KEY-354253: I accept his apology, we're never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things but hopefully we can get back to the job of managing our football clubs now
KEY-354254: I actually agree with him to an extent, [%team#2] were very complacent today, I've got no idea why that is being seen as a criticism of us though when in actual fact it's a pretty damning indictment of [%person#2] and his ability as a motivator
KEY-354255: I actually agree with him to an extent, teams aren't taking us seriously and we're certainly profiting from their complacency. I've got no idea why that is being seen as a criticism of us though when in actual fact it's a pretty damning indictment of the likes of [%person#2] and their ability as motivators
KEY-354256: I actually think he made some valid points and it's always interesting to be challenged on opinions in this game. I think our respective footballing ideas should make for a fascinating encounter on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354257: I actually think he made some valid points and it's always interesting to be challenged on your opinions in this game, I think our respective footballing ideas should make for a fascinating encounter on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354259: I agree with him that we're not overachieving but that's as far as it goes, we're where we are on merit and our performance levels have been exceptional, it's no more than I expected from this group of lads though, they've been fantastic and are finally getting rewarded for it
KEY-354260: I agree with [%person#2], there is a lot of pressure on both of us in this match but we'll thrive on it, neither of us are handing it better than the other, we're both focused on winning
KEY-354261: I always make sure my sides avoid complacency before any match so if that's what [%person#2-first] was trying it was never going to work, you can't blame him for trying to gain an advantage though, any other manager would do the same
KEY-354263: I am always looking to develop my approach and evolve as a manager, that's got nothing to do with [%person#2] though and I think he's being very disrespectful to a fellow professional in all honesty
KEY-354264: I apologise if that's how it came across, it was more a criticism of how some other sides have approached matches with them than a criticism of the work that [%person#2] is doing
KEY-354265: I apologise to [%person#2-first] and his players if that's how it came across but that certainly wasn't my intention. I was just stating my opinion on what I consider to be a good squad balance
KEY-354266: I apologise to [%person#2-first] and his players if that's how it came across but that certainly wasn't my intention. I was just stating my opinion on what I consider to be striking the right balance between domestic and foreign players
KEY-354267: I apologise to [%person#2-first] and his players if that's how it came across but that certainly wasn't my intention. I was just stating my opinion on what I consider to be striking the right balance
KEY-354268: I appreciate [%person#2-first] comments but I have to admit, I'd long since forgotten what the issue was in the first place. It's good to see that he is over it as well now
KEY-354269: I appreciate [%person#2-first] comments but I'm afraid to say I don't agree with them, we're in a real rut at the minute and it's difficult to see where a good result is going to come from
KEY-354270: I appreciate all of [%person#2-first] support over the last few days, it's good to know your work is appreciated by your peers and I hope the board pay attention to him regardless of the result today
KEY-354272: I appreciate the fact he didn't say anything to be honest, you guys in the media love to stir this kind of thing up and I think it shows real class from him to not get involved
KEY-354273: I can sympathise with his opinion to an extent, I think a lot of teams have failed to give us the respect we deserve lately and we've profited from that without a doubt, you can only beat what's put in front of you though and we'll be looking for another good result against his side
KEY-354275: I can't claim to know how [%person#2-first] is thinking about that, as a fellow professional though I'd assume he's more pleased with the result than with any personal victory over me
KEY-354276: I can't even remember what I said. It's of that little importance to me and [%person#2-first] obviously holds a grudge more than I do
KEY-354277: I can't pretend his comments didn't give me a bit of extra motivation. It's made the result all the sweeter knowing I made him crack under the pressure
KEY-354278: I can't pretend his comments didn't give me a bit of extra motivation. It's made the result all the sweeter knowing it's put him and his tin-pot club back in their place
KEY-354279: I can't pretend that it didn't give me a bit of extra motivation. Whether that was the cause of the result or not I don't know but he did play into my hands somewhat, yes
KEY-354280: I can't say I see the same player as [%person#2-surname] does. I'm not so easily impressed
KEY-354281: I can't say I wasn't a little pessimistic about our chances, [%person#2-first] has got his side playing some excellent football but I was pleased with how my boys coped, I think we were a little unlucky with the result
KEY-354282: I can't say I wasn't a little pessimistic about our chances. [%person#2-first] has got a great squad playing some excellent football but I was pleased with how my boys coped, I think we were a little unlucky with the result
KEY-354283: I can't say that it didn't make the match that little bit more important and I'm delighted to have put [%person#2-surname] in his place with that result
KEY-354284: I can't see how he'd be handling it any worse to be honest! I've hardly slept all week!
KEY-354287: I certainly didn't mean any disrespect. I just think that football in this country can learn a lot from outside influences and I think more managers would benefit from that way of thinking
KEY-354288: I certainly hope not, it's certainly not how it was intended, [%person#2-first] has really earned my respect with his side's performances and we certainly won't be treating this match lightly
KEY-354291: I certainly think [%person#2-first] can seem a bit disconnected from his fans, the result shows that for all his tactical nous, matches like this nearly always come down to who wants it more and he struggles with that side of the game
KEY-354292: I certainly think [%person#2-first] has shown that he is the right man to get them out of their current predicament, they were excellent today and I certainly think that's the end of their troubles now
KEY-354294: I certainly wouldn't want [%person#2-first] to think I'm singling him out here, you asked me what I thought about the possibility of him being sacked and I'm of the opinion that we might be the last side he faces as [%team#2] manager
KEY-354295: I couldn't believe it when I read what he'd said, it's almost as if he's already been beaten and we'll be looking to capitalise on his defeatist attitude
KEY-354297: I couldn't believe what I was hearing frankly, it's totally unacceptable for him to be speaking about a fellow professional's career like that. I just hope one day he knows what it's like to have this kind of speculation hanging over his head
KEY-354298: I couldn't believe what I was hearing, it's all very well trying to give your side an advantage before a match but for him to stoop to the kind of level where he is questioning some of the most dedicated professionals in the game was absolutely not on if you ask me
KEY-354299: I couldn't believe what I was hearing, it's all very well trying to give your side an advantage before a match but for him to stoop to the kind of level where he is targeting youngsters who are just starting out in the game was incredibly unprofessional if you ask me
KEY-354300: I couldn't care less about what he has or hasn't said. I'm just focusing on making sure we're well prepared for [%date#1-day] match
KEY-354301: I couldn't care less if that's what they think. I'm confident in my opinions and equally confident that my boys can prove me right on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354302: I couldn't care less what he thinks really, he is obviously disappointed with his team's performance against us out there and is looking to deflect attention away from his own shortcomings
KEY-354303: I couldn't care less what he's said to be honest, I'm in this job to win football matches not friends
KEY-354313: I don't know about that, I think my defence of [%person#2] was valid before the match and it's proven to be even more valid now. He's a great manager and we can learn a lot from the way he's got his side working so hard
KEY-354314: I don't know about that, I think my praise for the work [%person#2-first] has done there was valid before the match and even more so now. They were fantastic out there and we can learn a lot from their application levels and commitment
KEY-354315: I don't know about that, I'm trying my hardest to keep the lads grounded during all this but they continue to make it very difficult for me with performances like that!
KEY-354326: I don't know really but I know his supporters will be wanting a win as much as ours and that does mean an added layer of pressure for both of us. I'm confident I can handle it though and I'm sure he will be too
KEY-354327: I don't know really, [%person#2-first] has every right to voice his opinion but I think he might just be trying to deflect attention away from the result, it won't work though, there are no hiding places in big matches like that one
KEY-354328: I don't know really, [%person#2-first] has every right to voice his opinion but I think he might just be trying to deflect attention away from the result
KEY-354329: I don't know really, football matches are won and lost on the pitch and I don't think what's been said in the past few days had any real bearing on the result
KEY-354330: I don't know really, football matches are won and lost on the pitch and I don't think what's been said in the past few days had any real bearing on the result
KEY-354331: I don't know whether it's surprising, but it is pleasing. [%person#2-first] is a reasonable person and knows that perception counts for a lot in this game
KEY-354333: I don't know why [%person#2-surname] is commenting about me at all, it seems like he hasn't got enough confidence in his own ability or that of his team to discuss them instead
KEY-354335: I don't know, sometimes people need to hear harsh truths in this game and if he and his lads can't handle some frank words they might not be cut out for this profession
KEY-354337: I don't like to talk about other teams or managers really and would prefer to focus on the positives for my side, we're well prepared and confident of a good result on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354338: I don't like to talk about the situations of other teams really, I'd prefer to focus on the positives for my side, we're well prepared and confident of a good result on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354339: I don't like to talk about the strength of other teams really, I'd prefer to focus on the positives for my side, we're well prepared and confident of a good result on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354340: I don't necessarily think it's going to continue indefinitely, I'm just confident that it won't be coming to an end against us on [%date#1-day]. Anything could happen, but it won't be any of my concern
KEY-354341: I don't necessarily think it's proven me wrong but it's certainly showed me I should keep my mouth shut in future, they played like they had a point to prove and that's probably down to what I said before the match
KEY-354342: I don't need [%person#2] to tell me that I'm better than him, everyone will be able to see it for themselves once the match is finished on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354344: I don't pay much attention to that kind of thing really, I won't change my approach, we're all focused and looking forward to the match
KEY-354345: I don't pay too much attention to that kind of thing, every game of football is different and [%person#2-first] is too good a manager for us to be expecting an easy game on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354346: I don't really feel the need to justify preferences of style but I will say that I felt it necessary to impose ourselves on as many teams as possible as it both suits our players and unsettles theirs
KEY-354347: I don't really see any benefit in discussing what was said in the build-up to the match, we've got a great result and can move on to the next match with great confidence now
KEY-354349: I don't really see the point in discussing this sort of thing, why can't we focus on the football instead? It was a good game and that's what should be being talked about
KEY-354351: I don't really want to talk about what people have or haven't said, the football is the most important thing and I'm pleased with how things went today
KEY-354352: I don't really want to talk about what people have or haven't said. The football is the most important thing and I'm concentrating on moving on from this result and improving for our next match
KEY-354353: I don't see any reason why not, as long as we keep doing what we're doing by applying ourselves properly for every match there's no reason why we can't kick on and achieve even more than we already have
KEY-354354: I don't see any reason why that should be the case, the lads have done brilliantly in recent weeks and one result doesn't change that, we just need to get our focus back and regroup for the next match now
KEY-354355: I don't see any value in discussing anything other than what happened on the pitch. We have to address what went wrong and come back stronger, that is all I care about at the minute
KEY-354358: I don't see complacency as an issue, we're confident in our ability for sure but that confidence stems from the fact we approach games in the right manner and this is no different
KEY-354359: I don't see it as a lack of support, [%person#2-first] had some words in private with me after the match which I won't share but it's safe to say I'm not worried by him avoiding any of your questions
KEY-354360: I don't see it as getting one over on [%person#2-first] though, we had a chat after the match and there are no bad feelings between the two of us but I think the result speaks for itself in terms of my motivation
KEY-354363: I don't think I get on with [%person#2-first] better or worse than any other professional I encounter, I'm happy to get a result like that regardless of the opponent
KEY-354364: I don't think I get on with [%person#2-first] better or worse than any other professional I encounter, I'm unhappy to get a result like that regardless of the opponent
KEY-354365: I don't think my ability under pressure had anything to do with the result, managers have to rely on their team to handle the pressure as well and unfortunately some of my players couldn't hack it
KEY-354366: I don't think my comments had any impact at all on the match. I still stand by what I said but unfortunately we were our own worst enemies out there and couldn't capitalise on their failings
KEY-354367: I don't think my comments had any impact on the result whatsoever. Football matches are won and lost on the pitch not in press conferences
KEY-354368: I don't think my handling of the occasion had anything to do with the result, managers have to rely on their team to handle the pressure as well and unfortunately some of my players couldn't hack it, they've let the fans down today and they're the ones who are really suffering
KEY-354369: I don't think he's got more desire than me but even if he did, I'm the better manager and ability will always win out over desire
KEY-354370: I don't think his comments had any impact at all, we've got ourselves in this position by taking each game as it comes and ignoring all of the talk about us, this was no different and we'll look to kick on even further now
KEY-354371: I don't think his expenditure is relevant at all really, results can be very deceptive sometimes and [%person#2-first] is actually doing a pretty good job as far as I'm concerned, we'll have to be at our very best to get anything out of the match on [%date#1-day] because their poor run won't last forever
KEY-354372: I don't think about that sort of thing really. We'll approach this game as we would any other, focused on our own game and ready to work hard for a positive result
KEY-354373: I don't think an unwillingness to adapt is necessarily a weakness, I think we're good enough for teams to have to adapt to our style, not vice-versa
KEY-354374: I don't think anyone thought they'd be doing this well and a lot of credit has to go to [%person#2-first] for that, he's working miracles with them and we'll have to be at our best to get a good result on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354376: I don't think anything backfired, we just weren't at our best out there and a lot of credit has to go to [%person#2-first] and his experienced side for taking advantage of that. What they lacked in fitness they more than made up for in know-how today
KEY-354377: I don't think anything backfired, we just weren't at our best out there and a lot of credit has to go to [%person#2-first] and his side for taking advantage of that. I'm disappointed that my boys couldn't capitalise on what I still maintain are failings in his squad
KEY-354378: I don't think anything backfired, we just weren't at our best out there and a lot of credit has to go to [%person#2-first] and his young side for taking advantage of that. What they lack in experience they more than made up for in commitment and application today
KEY-354379: I don't think desire comes into it if I'm honest, winning football matches is about a lot more than just wanting to win them, we need to be methodical in our preparation and everything else will fall into place
KEY-354380: I don't think either of our pre-match comments had any influence on the match, you lot always like to make mountains out of molehills when it comes to this sort of thing. I need to focus on footballing matters and rebounding from the result not on what I or anybody else has said
KEY-354381: I don't think it affects our planning, no. The lads will all have that bit of extra desire though which you can only get from matches like this
KEY-354382: I don't think it could be seen as an inferiority complex, no. [%person#2-first] is a good manager but I think I'm better than him and have better players available to me
KEY-354383: I don't think it's a case of being vindicated. I'm in the business of winning football matches and I've got a lot of confidence in my squad to help me do that regardless of what [%person#2-first] or anybody else has to say about it
KEY-354384: I don't think it's an unwillingness to adapt so much as having to make do with what I have available to me, I'd love to be able to spring tactical surprises every match but I just don't have the squad required to do that
KEY-354385: I don't think it's at all fair to say I lack passion, I wanted a good result as much as anybody but letting that desire affect my decisions is not the way I like to manage my football team
KEY-354386: I don't think it's at all fair to say I lack passion. I wanted a good result as much as anybody but letting that desire affect my decisions is not the way I like to manage my football team regardless of how much the fans might want to see it
KEY-354387: I don't think it's been the most positive time for either club. Nobody likes to see the football being overshadowed and I hope we can all start focusing on more important matters soon
KEY-354388: I don't think it's like that, [%person#2-first] had a chat with me after the match and clarified his comments, he is one of the good guys in football and there is no issue between the two of us
KEY-354389: I don't think it's outdated, the very fact that I'm still getting results with it shows that. Football is a very Darwinian game at times, if an approach stops being effective it will very quickly stop being used
KEY-354390: I don't think it's unfair no, they're on a terrific run but history has shown us that teams sustaining this kind of overachievement is a real rarity so I'm just being realistic about their chances
KEY-354391: I don't think it's unfair no, we're confident of a good result against them on [%date#1-day] and that will only increase the pressure on [%person#2-first]. How he deals with it will be key to whether they turn it around
KEY-354392: I don't think it's unfair to say that I look up to [%person#2-first] as a professional, the only way to improve in this job is to gain experience from your peers even if they're rivals
KEY-354393: I don't think it's unfair to say that I look up to [%person#2-first] as a professional. The only way to improve in this job is to gain experience from your peers
KEY-354394: I don't think it's unfair to say that they're performing an awful lot better than many expected them to, myself included. Ultimately the results don't lie though and they have to be treated as a good side at this point
KEY-354395: I don't think passion has anything to do with it. The fans want to see a victory not a manager making it all about [%person#2-himself]
KEY-354397: I don't think reputation has anything to do with it, [%team#2] don't have a divine right to perform at the top level all the time and I think people need to cut [%person#2-first] some slack
KEY-354398: I don't think revenge has anything to do with it, [%person#2-first] is a great professional at the end of the day and I think it will be a good match whatever happens
KEY-354399: I don't think so no, [%person#2-first] will be happy with the result but that is none of my concern, I'm more focused on making sure we can get a positive result next time
KEY-354400: I don't think so no, [%person#2-first] will be happy with the result but that is none of my concern. I'm more focused on making sure we can get a positive result for the fans next time because they're the ones who are really suffering today
KEY-354401: I don't think so no, [%person#2-first] side are where they are on merit, we have to take them seriously and I won't be allowing any complacency at all from our lads
KEY-354402: I don't think so no, as I said, they're not performing at the level you'd expect at the minute but they've come up against some fantastic sides recently and that's the nature of the game
KEY-354403: I don't think so no, things didn't go in our favour out there today but I don't think anything that was said between the two of us had much to do with that, the lads are all professional enough to not let anything like that distract them and it was water off a duck's back for me personally as well
KEY-354404: I don't think so no. I know you've got to fill your pages somehow but I've not got anything to say about [%person#2-first] and I'm afraid you're going to have to look elsewhere if you want a sensationalist headline tomorrow
KEY-354405: I don't think so, I always knew we would be in for a tough match today despite their perceived underachievement, [%person#2-first] is too good a manager for us to have got an easy ride and I think they'll probably kick on now
KEY-354406: I don't think so, I always knew we would be in for a tough match today given how well [%person#2-first] has got them performing and that proved to be the case. I think they'll continue to go from strength to strength in the coming weeks
KEY-354407: I don't think so, I'd like to think he was being genuine, we've been doing incredibly well lately and the lads deserve all the plaudits they're getting as far as I'm concerned because it might not last too much longer
KEY-354408: I don't think so, I'm just answering the question you asked me, there's nothing disrespectful about expressing an opinion
KEY-354409: I don't think so, [%person#2-first] and his golden oldies wouldn't have got to this stage in their careers if they let a few comments get to them, I was just stating a fact that fitness could be an issue for them on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354411: I don't think so, [%person#2-first] has got some of the real elder statesmen of the game in his squad but we still should be able to match them if we get our preparation right
KEY-354412: I don't think so, [%person#2-first] is a good manager and I'm pretty sure he wasn't affected by anything the press were trying to drum up in the build-up to the match
KEY-354413: I don't think so, [%person#2-first] is a manager I respect and he'll be happy with the result but I need to focus on what went wrong and on rectifying it rather than anything that's been said by him
KEY-354414: I don't think so, [%person#2-first] will have a lot on his plate at the minute and I don't think anything can be achieved by me adding any more fuel to the fire regardless of whether I support him or not
KEY-354415: I don't think so, he is probably just trying to deflect attention back onto me to try to add some extra pressure to the match
KEY-354417: I don't think so, [%person#2] isn't someone I see posing too many problems for me and I think we can get a good result on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354418: I don't think so, if anything I was offering a bit of advice to a fellow professional on how to get the best out of his squad and I think the addition of a few younger legs would go a long way
KEY-354419: I don't think so, if anything I was offering a bit of advice to a fellow professional on how to get the best out of his young squad and I think the addition of a bit of experience would go a long way
KEY-354420: I don't think so, if anything it made things more difficult for us, they were fantastic out there and made us work hard for our result, so much so that I have to admit I got it wrong in the build-up, [%person#2-first] is doing a great job
KEY-354421: I don't think so, it's my job to make sure my team are up for it and this has added an extra dimension which has given me even more motivation to get a good result on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354422: I don't think so, they've got no right to be performing at the level they are currently and I can't stand this flash-in-a-pan gushing that goes alongside them, I can't wait to put them back in their place
KEY-354423: I don't think so, until [%person#2] can start to get them performing as a unit on a regular basis I just can't see them turning it around, confidence is at rock bottom at the club and that can be impossible to rebuild sometimes
KEY-354424: I don't think so, we just weren't at our best out there and came up against a good side with a talented manager, we'll learn from this and are looking forward to setting things right next time out
KEY-354425: I don't think so, you need a pretty thick skin to succeed as a manager and I'm sure [%person#2-first] can handle a difference of opinion on playing styles
KEY-354426: I don't think that [%person#2-first] passion is any greater than mine. What I will say is that he got his footballing decisions right and I have to congratulate him on the result as much as it stings
KEY-354427: I don't think that [%person#2-first] passion is any greater than mine. What I will say is that he got his footballing decisions right and I have to congratulate him on the result
KEY-354428: I don't think that has anything to do with it, passion is for the fans, it shouldn't come into a manager's thinking when preparing for a match I'm much more interested in focusing on what went wrong in footballing terms
KEY-354429: I don't think that has anything to do with it. Passion is for the fans, it shouldn't come into a manager's thinking when preparing for a match. I'm much more interested in focusing on what went wrong in footballing terms
KEY-354431: I don't think that's fair, [%person#2-first] is a great manager with a real passion for winning football matches but so am I and I think we'll see a great match on [%date#1-day] as a result
KEY-354432: I don't think that's fair, no. [%person#2-first] has his methods and I have my own; we'll see who comes out on top on [%date#1-day] but I'm not showing any disrespect by expressing an opinion before the match
KEY-354433: I don't think that's fair. I've got just as much desire as him if not more, that's why I have to make sure we don't let ourselves get drawn into all the extra hype of a match like this
KEY-354434: I don't think that's the case really. [%person#2-first] has been very complimentary about us but he has a great side as well, it should be a great match
KEY-354435: I don't think that's the case, I'm always disappointed when we don't get a good result, my comments about [%person#2-first] side didn't mean I had thrown the towel in
KEY-354436: I don't think the fans are interested in what [%person#2-first] has said in the past either, they want to see their team winning and I think focusing on football, not personal rivalries, is the best way to achieve that
KEY-354437: I don't think the result shows that his comments backfired necessarily, more that they were just incorrect in the first place, we've got a good group here and we're confident in the way we play and showed that [%person#2-first] was wide of the mark
KEY-354438: I don't think there is such a thing as overconfidence, we approach every game with belief in the fact that we can win it, I don't think that is something I'd want to change
KEY-354439: I don't think there was too much wrong with what he said but I think it might just give the lads a bit of extra desire to put in a good performance on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354440: I don't think there was too much wrong with what he said personally but I know that the older lads will have been listening and I'm certain it will have fired them up to get a good result. He's probably given my team talk for me frankly
KEY-354441: I don't think there was too much wrong with what he said personally but he's probably given my team talk for me frankly, the foreign lads will be desperate to get out there and prove a point now
KEY-354442: I don't think there's any value in discussing what [%person#2] has said to be honest. We're all just focused on building on this result and getting back where we belong
KEY-354444: I don't think there's even any point discussing that really, my focus is on bouncing back not on anything [%person#2] has said
KEY-354445: I don't think there's much anybody can do if it's technically within the laws of the game, but it's never nice to see players suffer as a result and perhaps a change of heart is needed
KEY-354447: I don't think they had any impact at all really, I was impressed with them before the match and I'm still impressed with them, they worked incredibly hard to try and get back into the game and are a real credit to the work [%person#2-first] has done with them
KEY-354448: I don't think we're going to see [%person#2] change his mind any time soon. Why should he?
KEY-354449: I don't want to comment about my own position but I agree with [%person#2-first] that not enough time is given to managers these days and it's a trend that I think all managers would like to see an end of really
KEY-354450: I don't want to comment on his comments too much but let's just say I'm not confident that I'll be able to keep this job much longer without a change in fortune
KEY-354451: I don't want to discuss [%person#2-first] position, I'm just focusing on bouncing back from this result, we need to work hard on getting back on track
KEY-354452: I don't want to waste my breath talking about him to be honest. He's showed what an unprofessional person he is and I have no desire to stoop to his level
KEY-354454: I don't want to waste any more time talking about other teams, we need to focus on our own performance and how we can improve going forward
KEY-354455: I doubt it, [%person#2-first] wouldn't have been able to get as far as he has with that kind of small-club mentality even if they are surprising everyone in football at the minute
KEY-354456: I feel bad for the [%team#2] fans personally, who wants to pay good money to see a load of sideways passes? We'll be looking to show his fans what real football is about with a positive performance on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354457: I feel it's about time something is done, otherwise teams like [%team#2-short] will continue to play with reckless abandon and endanger the careers of others
KEY-354458: I find his obsession with us quite amusing frankly, you'd think that he'd be focused on a good result for his side but here he is discussing me instead, he just can't help [%person#2-himself] can he?
KEY-354459: I forget who it was that said you don't win anything with kids, they were bang on though, [%person#2-first] side are crying out for some experienced players and we're ready to show just how much he needs them
KEY-354460: I found it all a bit disingenuous really, it's very easy to be complimentary about an opponent you got the better of, I think you'd have seen a very different [%person#2] had things not gone his way out there
KEY-354461: I found it all a bit laughable, he might need to rethink his line of work if he is that easily swayed in his approach!
KEY-354462: I found it quite amusing if I'm honest. I think [%person#2-first] was probably just trying to liven up his press conference a bit
KEY-354463: I had a chat with [%person#2-first] after the match and set a few things straight between the two of us, there's no problem between us as far as I'm concerned
KEY-354464: I hardly expect it to go down well, but by the same token I don't care about that
KEY-354465: I have no problem admitting I don't respect [%person#2-first] footballing style but that doesn't necessarily mean I don't respect him personally
KEY-354466: I have to admit I am a bit overawed by the prospect of facing him. I hope his side have an off day and we can come out unscathed
KEY-354467: I have to admit I am a bit overawed by the prospect of facing him. I know my fans won't like hearing this but they're a great side and he's an even better manager, I hope they have an off day and we can come out unscathed
KEY-354468: I have to admit I am feeling the pressure a lot, the fans won't take anything less than a win against [%team#2] and that weight of expectation can make things difficult as a manager
KEY-354469: I have to admit I am feeling the pressure a lot, this is one of those matches where the fear of losing can sometimes outweigh the joy of winning and I just want it to be full-time already!
KEY-354470: I have to admit I find it all a bit patronising really, we're where we are because we've underperformed, no amount of words from [%person#2-surname] will change that, it's down to the lads to put things right
KEY-354471: I have to admit I find it all a bit patronising really, we're where we are on merit and it's about time people started taking us seriously
KEY-354472: I have to admit I got it wrong in the build-up, I underestimated [%person#2-first] as a manager and certainly didn't see that result coming today, he's proven he's got what it takes to continue as [%team#2] manager
KEY-354473: I have to admit I was hoping my comments might have made [%person#2-first] lads question their ability a bit but unfortunately it seems like they did backfire and I inspired them to a great performance
KEY-354474: I have to admit I was hoping my comments might have made [%person#2-first] old guard question their ability to perform at this level a bit but unfortunately it seems like they did backfire and I inspired them to a great performance
KEY-354475: I have to admit I was hoping my comments would lead to them believing their own hype a bit and I think that's what happened, they've got themselves in this position by working hard as underdogs and I think they struggled with the extra expectation I put on them today
KEY-354476: I have to admit I was hoping my praise for [%person#2-surname] before the match might just lead to a bit of complacency from his side and I'm delighted that that's proven to be the case
KEY-354477: I have to admit I was trying to pile a bit more pressure on [%person#2-first] but I've been left with egg on my face given the result. He is a lot tougher mentally than I thought he was
KEY-354478: I have to admit I was trying to play a few mind games with [%person#2-first] but I've been left with egg on my face given the result. He is a lot tougher mentally than I thought he was
KEY-354479: I have to admit I'm a little surprised. I think maybe [%person#2-first] and his side had something of a hangover following their success and we capitalised on a lethargic performance from them very well indeed
KEY-354480: I have to admit I've been looking forward to this, hopefully we can bag a few on [%date#1-day] to give our strikers a big boost in confidence for the next few weeks
KEY-354481: I have to admit that I cringed a bit reading back some of my pre-match comments. I should apologise to [%person#2-first] really, there was no need for me to get involved in a confrontation like that and I regret it, it's not how we behave at this club
KEY-354482: I have to admit that I've cringed a bit reading back some of my pre-match comments, I should apologise to [%person#2-first] really, there was no need for me to get involved in a confrontation like that and I regret it
KEY-354483: I have to apologise to the fans, matches like this mean everything to them and we let them down, we need to try and move on quickly and avoid dwelling on this too much but it will sting for a few days yet for sure
KEY-354484: I have to apologise to the fans, matches like this mean everything to them and we let them down, we need to try and move on quickly and avoid dwelling on this too much
KEY-354485: I have to congratulate [%person#2-first] on his recent achievement, nobody deserves it more than him. He's one of football's finest and I'll be offering my congratulations to him in person after the match
KEY-354487: I have to say my opinion of [%person#2] changed over the course of the match. I wasn't impressed with some of the tactics he employed in trying to get into the game and I'm pleased to have come away with a good result over him
KEY-354488: I have to say my opinion of [%person#2] changed over the course of the match. I wasn't impressed with some of the tactics he employed in trying to get into the game and I'm relishing the chance to get some revenge the next time we meet
KEY-354489: I hope it wasn't taken that way, it's certainly not how it was intended, [%person#2-first] is a very talented manager and I think that they'll come good, people get too focused on the short term in this game sometimes without considering the bigger picture for a club
KEY-354490: I hope not but a manager of his ability could well be feeling the pressure less. I just hope that his players aren't quite as collected as he seems to be
KEY-354491: I hope not, losing any match is bad enough but it would be even worse now if I had to deal with losing to someone like [%person#2] and his tin-pot club
KEY-354492: I hope not, losing any match is bad enough but it would be even worse now if I had to deal with losing to someone like [%person#2]
KEY-354493: I hope not, the players will all be aware of the importance of the match and I'm hoping for a good show of character from them
KEY-354494: I hope not, the players will all be aware of the importance of the match to the fans and I'm hoping for a good show of character from my lads to give them the bragging rights
KEY-354495: I hope people recognise that football is all about different ideas and cultures. It would be boring if we all played the same way
KEY-354496: I hope so but I'm afraid I don't share his confidence. I love being in charge of this club and am desperate to continue but I'm still fearing the worst at the minute
KEY-354498: I just don't think these are football people though, the game has become infected by too many of the decision makers being utterly clueless about the game we love and it seems to me that [%team#2] are a very good example of that
KEY-354500: I just hope he starts feeling the pressure that comes along with speculation about your job, he can be sure he won't find any support coming from me if things start going against him
KEY-354501: I just think it proves my comments before the match right, we always knew we were in for a tough match today and that proved to be the case, [%person#2] side worked incredibly hard for their manager and things are looking up for him now
KEY-354502: I just think it shows the extra level of professionalism at our club, we handled ourselves properly before and during the match, that might be the difference between [%person#2] and myself and the reason we got the result we wanted today
KEY-354503: I knew it was going to be tough and that proved to be the case, sometimes you come up against a team and a manager on a real high and it's impossible to get anything out of the match, that proved to be the case today
KEY-354504: I knew their run couldn't last and I'm delighted to be the one who's put a stop to it, hopefully now all the fawning will stop and [%person#2] will be exposed as nothing more than an average manager enjoying a rare moment of success
KEY-354505: I knew there was no danger of them turning a corner any time soon and that's proven to be the case, we didn't even have to be at our best to get a result out there, things are going to get an awful lot worse for [%person#2] before they get better
KEY-354506: I know he'll definitely be feeling it and I think it's quite likely that he's struggling with it as well, whether or not he's handled it will become clear at the final whistle
KEY-354507: I know he'll definitely be feeling it as well but it's way too early to be talking about who is handling it better. The result will speak for itself and I hope we can come out on top on the day
KEY-354509: I know what [%person#2-first] was trying to do and his mind games are part and parcel of the game now, it's nice to see them backfire though for sure
KEY-354511: I learned after our last match not to let anything he says get to me. I'm just focused on getting a positive result on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354512: I learnt a lot about [%person#2-first] side, the levels of commitment and determination they showed were very surprising to me and hopefully I've learned from it and we can improve as a side moving forward
KEY-354513: I learnt a lot about [%person#2-first] side, they might not have the best fitness in the world but the experience and know-how which I had written off ended up being very valuable, hopefully my boys can take something from that
KEY-354514: I learnt a lot about [%person#2-first] side, they might not have the most experience in the world but they've got talent in abundance and he is doing a great job to get performances like that out of them
KEY-354515: I learnt a lot about [%person#2-first] side, they showed that you don't necessarily need a large foreign influence to play good football. I've learned from it and hopefully we can improve as a side moving forward
KEY-354516: I lost what little respect I had for [%person#2-first] when I saw him trying to play this down, we don't like each other and there is no point trying to hide that as far as I'm concerned
KEY-354517: I might have bitten off a bit more than I could chew this time around. Maybe I'll leave the mind games to somebody else in future
KEY-354518: I might risk annoying some of our fans here but [%person#2-first] is a great manager with great passion for his team, I think you lot in the media have been a bit harsh on him since our match to be honest, his side showed a lot of fight out there and that was his doing
KEY-354520: I need to have a thick skin in this job and luckily I've got just that, he's entitled to his opinion but it has no impact on me whatsoever
KEY-354521: I personally like [%person#2-first] style, it's a bit of a throwback to an older era but it can still be very effective and we'll need to execute our game plan well if we want a positive result
KEY-354522: I personally relish the extra pressure of this kind of match. You're in the wrong job if you can't enjoy the challenge of a rivalry like this and come out on top
KEY-354523: I personally relish these encounters, you're in the wrong job if you can't get yourself fired up for a match as big as this and we're hoping to give the fans the bragging rights on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354524: I personally think people go a bit overboard with their praise for [%team#2], they've always looked pretty pedestrian to me and I'm confident we can get a positive result
KEY-354525: I personally try not to pay attention to what people are saying or writing about me. My focus is now and always has been on winning football matches with [%team#1]
KEY-354526: I really appreciated that from [%person#2-first] it showed a real touch of class and my opinion of him has gone up a lot as a result, there's definitely no issues between the two of us and everyone involved can move on now
KEY-354527: I really appreciated that, it takes a big person to admit they were wrong and I've got to apologise for my part in it all as well, we can put this behind us now and I'm looking forward to coming up against him on better terms next time
KEY-354528: I really don't know I'm afraid, the result won't have helped him of course but I still think he deserves more time to turn things around
KEY-354529: I relish results like this, they're what I'm in this job for and this is no different. [%person#2] can try his mind games on someone else but I've shown they won't work with me
KEY-354530: I relish results like this, they're what I'm in this job for and this is no different. [%person#2] can try his mind games on someone else but I've shown they won't work with me
KEY-354531: I should probably thank him really, his comments obviously backfired a bit as they gave us that little bit of extra motivation which definitely contributed to the result and I'm pleased to have sent the fans home happy
KEY-354532: I still can't quite believe that result given the amount of pressure we were under, we nearly fell short under the weight of the occasion and I'm very relieved
KEY-354533: I still can't quite believe that result given the amount of pressure we were under, we nearly fell short under the weight of the occasion
KEY-354534: I still don't think that will be enough for him to keep his job but I've got to admit it was daft of me to get involved with that discussion before the match, I basically gave his team talk for him
KEY-354536: I take everything he says with a pinch of salt to be honest, he is just trying to get under my skin by playing down the importance of the game
KEY-354538: I take it all with a pinch of salt to be honest, so much gets said in the press these days that it's difficult to take anything at face value. It wouldn't surprise me at all if [%person#2-first] was just trying to play mind games with me
KEY-354539: I think I can live with that risk, I'm very confident of getting a good result on [%date#1-day], [%person#2] and his club don't pose any kind of threat to me
KEY-354540: I think I can live with that risk, I'm very confident of getting a good result on [%date#1-day], [%person#2] doesn't pose any kind of threat to me
KEY-354541: I think I might have fired him up a bit yes, sometimes you need a bit of extra motivation and unfortunately I provided that for him. My comments have backfired and he took advantage brilliantly
KEY-354542: I think I'd be more bothered by it if I had any respect for [%person#2-surname] but hearing that sort of criticism coming from him doesn't bother me at all, it all just reeks of sour grapes to me
KEY-354543: I think I'd be more bothered by it if I had any respect for [%person#2-surname] but hearing that sort of criticism coming from him doesn't bother me at all; He can gloat all he wants, ultimately I'll still be enjoying my success regardless of what he says
KEY-354546: I think my criticism is very valid and after we've finished with them on [%date#1-day] I think the plaudits might just dry up for [%person#2]
KEY-354547: I think [%person#2-first] and his scouting team have done fantastically well to identify players who might not have been so well known in this country and they deserve a lot of credit for that
KEY-354548: I think [%person#2-first] certainly did his best to increase the pressure on us before the match and ultimately his side have come away with a good result, maybe I need to work on being less affected by this sort of thing
KEY-354549: I think [%person#2-first] certainly did his best to increase the pressure on us before the match and ultimately his side have come away with a good result. Maybe I need to work on being less affected by occasions like this if I want to give our fans the bragging rights next time
KEY-354551: I think [%person#2-first] has a thick enough skin to not take offence to a difference in footballing ethos, you guys are just trying to stir things up
KEY-354552: I think [%person#2-first] has to take a lot of credit for the trust he has placed in his young players, it's refreshing to see and the extra enthusiasm you often see from youngsters is something we'll need to be wary of
KEY-354553: I think [%person#2-first] is getting a bit carried away if he thinks I was trying to get under his skin. I just answer the questions you lot ask me, there's nothing more to it than that
KEY-354556: I think [%person#2-first] is just playing mind games a bit really, I've got a lot of confidence in my methods and today's result doesn't change that at all
KEY-354557: I think [%person#2-first] is just trying to deflect attention away from his side's performance and I can't blame him for that; we've all been guilty of it at some point in our managerial careers
KEY-354559: I think [%person#2-first] is just trying to wind me up, the match is over now and I was hoping to move on but obviously he can't let bygones be bygones
KEY-354560: I think [%person#2-first] knows exactly what he's doing; I take everything he says with a pinch of salt to be honest, he will be fully up for the fight on the day
KEY-354561: I think [%person#2-first] knows exactly what he's doing; I take everything he says with a pinch of salt to be honest. He is just playing mind games and I'm too focused on the match to pay much attention
KEY-354562: I think [%person#2-first] must be trying to wind me up or something, our problems at the minute are pretty deep rooted and one good result isn't going to change the fact that this has been a bit of a disastrous campaign for us
KEY-354563: I think [%person#2-first] should focus on his own job and leave the international domain to me.
KEY-354564: I think [%person#2-first] was just a bit fired up after the match last time around, I don't have any issues with him and certainly don't see this as a grudge match or anything daft like that
KEY-354565: I think [%person#2-first] was just trying to defend a fellow professional but ultimately his comments were wide of the mark, there is no need for remarks like that regardless of the speculation about my career here
KEY-354566: I think [%person#2-first] was trying to defend me a bit in his own way, we're on a poor run but people are getting a bit carried away at the minute, we may improve and we may not but either way our current situation isn't a disaster
KEY-354567: I think [%person#2-first] comments are going to fall on deaf ears unfortunately, as much as I'd like to be given a bit more time here I'm not confident of it happening
KEY-354568: I think [%person#2-first] comments were unprofessional and piled even more pressure onto an already volatile occasion so I'm pleased to have handled it better than him given the circumstances
KEY-354569: I think [%person#2-first] comments were unprofessional and piled even more pressure onto the occasion so I'm pleased to have handled it better than him given the circumstances
KEY-354570: I think he is displaying a real lack of respect for me and more importantly to home-grown players up and down the country. I'm sure at some point he'll sit down and realise he's been out of order
KEY-354571: I think he is displaying a real lack of respect for me and more importantly to some of the elder statesmen of football who have given an awful lot to this sport. I'm sure at some point he'll sit down and realise he's been out of order
KEY-354572: I think he is displaying a real lack of respect for me and more importantly to some very talented foreign players. I'm sure at some point he'll sit down and realise he's been out of order
KEY-354573: I think he is displaying a real lack of respect for me and more importantly to the young players at the club, they're still learning their trade and the unprofessional input of someone like [%person#2] isn't helping anyone
KEY-354575: I think he might be right unfortunately. I don't think the board will tolerate our current form much longer so we're in desperate need of a result on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354576: I think he might be someone who struggles with that added desire for a win, we'll have to hope there are some extra nerves that we can capitalise on come kick off
KEY-354577: I think he might have a point actually, we had to be at our very best and hope that they had an off day to get a result out there and luckily both of those things happened, [%person#2-first] has every right to feel a bit aggrieved
KEY-354578: I think he might have a point unfortunately, it's been increasingly difficult to keep some of the lads grounded during this good run and there were signs of complacency today that I wasn't at all happy with and will be looking to address in the next few days
KEY-354579: I think he needs to grow up if I'm honest, there are people in every walk of life that you're just not going to get along with, football is no different and it's about time he realised that
KEY-354581: I think he's been bang out of order there, it's very unprofessional of him to be making those sorts of remarks and my opinion of him has gone down a lot
KEY-354582: I think he's being pretty disrespectful to a club of our standing frankly, nobody here is happy with how things are going and he's just provided me with the perfect team talk to turn things around against him on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354583: I think he's finally lost it if I'm honest. I met with him before and after the match to clear things up so I'm really not sure what his problem is
KEY-354584: I think he's finally lost it if I'm honest. I shook his hand before and after the match so I'm really not sure what his problem is
KEY-354585: I think he's playing mind games a bit here, it's clear to everyone that we're not doing as well as we should be and I think he's hoping we start to believe we can't kick on and improve, we'll show him how wrong he is on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354586: I think he's probably right unfortunately. I love being in charge of this club and am desperate to continue but I'm fearing the worst at the minute
KEY-354587: I think he's saying all the right things and it'll be better for his club in the long run
KEY-354588: I think his comments backfired a bit as they gave us that little bit of extra motivation which definitely contributed to the result. I guess I should probably thank him really!
KEY-354589: I think [%person#2-surname] might be a little bit biased towards his own players
KEY-354591: I think [%person#2] has just proven how out of his depth he really is, he tried to get under my skin before the match and I've put him right back in his place today
KEY-354592: I think [%person#2] might be right unfortunately, we were outplayed by his side today and it might have to be back to the drawing board in terms of my approach moving forward
KEY-354593: I think [%person#2] was obviously rattled by somebody actually expressing a frank opinion about him for a change and that showed in his side's performance, we outplayed them and I can't honestly say that I didn't expect to
KEY-354594: I think [%person#2] was right, nerves are only natural in games like this and I'm no different to anybody else. The match could be a cagey affair as a result of what's at stake
KEY-354595: I think a good result was a bit of a foregone conclusion today given how in awe [%person#2-surname] seemed of us in the build-up, his side looked like they didn't think they could beat us today and I think his comments have a lot to do with that
KEY-354596: I think any side managed by [%person#2-first] would have an advantage to be honest, he is a great manager and I hope to emulate him one day
KEY-354597: I think beneath the surface he isn't coping with the pressure very well to be honest and that nervousness could well be apparent during the match
KEY-354599: I think everyone gets a bit too hung up on foreign players sometimes. The important thing is that he has talented players and we'll have to be at our best to get a good result. Where they come from is neither here nor there as far as I'm concerned
KEY-354600: I think everyone gets a bit too hung up on this sort of thing sometimes. The important thing is that we, as managers, have talented players. Where they come from is neither here nor there as far as I'm concerned
KEY-354602: I think everyone is getting too hung up on this underachievement phrase, football is an unpredictable game, that's why we love it, [%person#2-first] will be pleased to have got the result today but that doesn't mean his troubles are over
KEY-354603: I think everything has got a bit out of hand with me and [%person#2-first], we should both put this to bed now and focus on more important matters for our clubs, a sporting rivalry is a very positive thing but it's gone too far on this occasion unfortunately
KEY-354604: I think everything has got a bit out of hand with me and [%person#2-first], we should both put this to bed now and focus on more important matters for our clubs
KEY-354605: I think it can only be a good thing to see home-grown players playing regularly. [%person#2-first] has developed a great squad and we'll need to be at our best to get a result
KEY-354606: I think it could well have done, it's difficult to remain professional when confronted with someone like [%person#2-surname] and that could have translated to an unprofessional performance from the lads. Luckily most of the managers you encounter handle themselves a lot better than him and I'm looking forward to moving on to the next match
KEY-354608: I think it shows we've got him rattled, if he is having to adapt his game plan to counter us it shows that I'm doing something right
KEY-354609: I think it was my ability as a manager which got us the result, not anything [%person#2] said, hopefully it's shown the board that I'm worth keeping around
KEY-354610: I think it was bang out of order for [%person#2-surname] to have said that, we've done marvellously well to get in this position and have earned a bit more respect than he's shown us with his comments today
KEY-354611: I think it was incredibly disrespectful of [%person#2-surname] to have spoken about me like that, the boys are all itching to get a result against him on [%date#1-day] and shut him up for good
KEY-354612: I think it was less about him being disrespectful and more about him showing what a dinosaur he is in footballing terms. I can't believe that we're still having discussions about foreign players in this day and age
KEY-354613: I think it was very unprofessional of him. These lads are at a crucial stage of their footballing development and this sort of unnecessary criticism does them no favours at all
KEY-354614: I think it was very unprofessional of him. He's talking about some of the elder statesmen of our sport here and I think they've earned a bit more respect than he's shown them
KEY-354616: I think it will ultimately cost him his job, so with that in mind I urge him to do as he pleases!
KEY-354617: I think it's a bit of a stretch to say anything backfired, despite what you lot like to think. What we say in press conferences doesn't have that much of an effect on what happens on the pitch
KEY-354618: I think it's a debate to be had by people far more interested in this than I am
KEY-354619: I think it's a shame in a lot of ways, we've got plenty of talented players in this country who would relish a chance at a club like [%team#2-short] but managers like [%person#2-surname] are making it impossible for them to get a look in
KEY-354620: I think it's a shame we've got to the stage where trying to keep a core of domestic players is somehow considered a bad thing. It's a sad state of affairs and I'm hoping to use his words to inspire a performance from the lads that will make him change his mind
KEY-354621: I think it's a vocal minority who took exception in the first place. It's not as big an issue as the media often make it seem
KEY-354622: I think it's bang out of order for him to be implying that about a fellow professional. Though I wouldn't expect any less from him and his tin-pot club to be honest, even with a result like that they find a way of showing how small-time they are
KEY-354623: I think it's bang out of order for him to be implying that about a fellow professional. I can't wait for a chance for revenge and we'll show him what pressure is next time around
KEY-354624: I think it's bang out of order to question my passion for this football club. [%person#2] will find out just how much I want to beat him next time around. We'll send our fans home happy next time, mark my words
KEY-354625: I think it's bang out of order to question my passion for this football club. [%person#2] will find out just how much I want to beat him next time around
KEY-354627: I think it's difficult to avoid when a club like that overachieves to this extent really, the general attitude of surprise at their performances will always be a bit demeaning by the very nature of it
KEY-354628: I think it's difficult to not think that really, it's starting to get a bit irritating frankly, we're where we are on merit and this patronising attitude towards us has got to stop
KEY-354629: I think it's fair to say I let the pressure get to me a little bit, I won't make that mistake again though and [%person#2] will find he has a much tougher game in store when we meet again
KEY-354630: I think it's fair to say I let the pressure get to me a little bit. I won't make that mistake again though and [%person#2] will find he has a much tougher game in store when we meet again and our fans will take home the bragging rights for sure
KEY-354631: I think it's fair to say that I exposed some of his mental fragility and got the result I was looking for, [%person#2-first] needs to develop a thicker skin if he wants to succeed in this job
KEY-354632: I think it's fair to say that I exposed some of his mental fragility and got the result I was looking for, [%person#2-first] needs to develop a thicker skin if he wants to succeed in this job
KEY-354633: I think it's fair to say that I was my own worst enemy before the match. My criticism obviously fired them up and we're paying the price now after a great performance from [%person#2-first] players
KEY-354634: I think it's fair to say that they're not performing at the level many expected but I think that says more about the quality of the opposition in this competition than it does about [%person#2-first] ability. This is a tough job and I'm sure he's the right person to turn things around for them
KEY-354635: I think it's fair to say that they're performing better than many expected them to, ultimately the results don't lie though and they have to be treated as a very good side at this point
KEY-354636: I think it's got totally out of hand, neither of us has behaved in a manner befitting a football manager in recent encounters and I have to apologise for my part in that, hopefully we can draw a line under this and move on now because it's becoming damaging to both of our clubs
KEY-354637: I think it's important to preserve the variety and uniqueness of each team, but at the same time players must be protected better than they currently are. Fans want to see the best players playing, not in the stands injured
KEY-354638: I think it's incredibly unprofessional of him to be making remarks like that, he has no idea of what is going on behind the scenes at this club and neither have any of you so this speculation about my career really needs to stop
KEY-354639: I think it's nonsense to suggest my comments backfired, [%person#2-first] side are a bit on the old side, that's not something that can be questioned, the fact that things didn't go our way today doesn't change that
KEY-354640: I think it's nonsense to suggest my comments backfired. I stand by everything I said before the match. The fact that things didn't go our way today doesn't change the fact that there are downsides to having an imbalanced squad when it comes to foreign imports
KEY-354641: I think it's nonsense to suggest my comments backfired. [%person#2-first] side do lack experience, that's not something that can be questioned, the fact that things didn't go our way today doesn't change that
KEY-354642: I think managers like [%person#2] are doing the game in this country no favours at all with their continual belittling of domestic players. I'm very passionate about the development of home-grown players and we're all desperate to prove a point on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354643: I think matches as big as this can be easier to prepare for in a lot of ways, the lads will all be even more motivated than usual simply because of who the opponents are and I'll be looking to utilise that extra desire to get a good result
KEY-354644: I think matches like this can sometimes make people a bit irrational. I like [%person#2-first], he's a good guy and I'm sure that after the match he'll look back on his comments and see that he got it wrong
KEY-354645: I think maybe a few of the lads thought they had something to prove to him after his comments but I can honestly say they didn't come into my thinking in the build-up to the match
KEY-354646: I think maybe that the occasion is getting to him a bit, it looks to me like he is trying to convince [%person#2-himself] that there is less riding on this match than there actually is. He'll be in for a rude awakening when he experiences the atmosphere on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354647: I think maybe that the pressure is getting to him a bit and it looks to me like he is trying to convince [%person#2-himself] that there is less riding on this match than there actually is
KEY-354648: I think our performance shows that [%person#2-first] and his side have really benefitted from complacency on the part of their opponents in recent weeks, I was very disappointed with our commitment and application out there and despite our superior ability, simple hard work was the difference today
KEY-354649: I think our performance was our undoing out there not anything I said before the match. I'm not at all happy with the application levels I saw from the boys today, it made me wonder if [%person#2-first] has just been benefitting from complacent opposition all along
KEY-354650: I think our performance was our undoing out there not anything I said before the match. I'm not at all happy with the application levels I saw from the boys today, they obviously underestimated [%team#2] given their current problems and thought they'd won the match before they even set foot on the pitch
KEY-354651: I think our performance was very poor today which is all the more galling given how weak our opponents were, there will never be a better time to play [%team#2] and this has to go down as a missed opportunity, I'm very disappointed
KEY-354652: I think people are getting a bit carried away really, they're doing very well at the minute but it's plain to see that it won't last and we'll be looking to bring them back down to earth on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354653: I think people are getting a bit carried away with the praise as a result of their constraints, they're doing very well at the minute but it's plain to see that it won't last without some kind of investment in the squad and we'll be looking to bring them back down to earth on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354654: I think people are getting a bit carried away with the praise, they're doing very well at the minute but it's plain to see that it won't last without [%person#2] strengthening his squad and we'll be looking to bring them back down to earth on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354655: I think putting the result down to my comments does an injustice to the job my boys did out there, their performance says more about the playing styles on display than anything said in a press conference could do
KEY-354656: I think results can be very deceptive sometimes and [%person#2-first] is actually doing a pretty good job as far as I'm concerned, we'll have to be at our very best to get anything out of the match on [%date#1-day] because their poor run won't last forever
KEY-354657: I think so but that's not to say that they're not a very talented bunch. I was impressed with how [%person#2-first] has got them performing and with a couple of experienced additions they will be a very good side
KEY-354658: I think so yes, I've always thought we just needed one result to go our way to really kick on and hopefully this is the one which will help us turn a corner
KEY-354659: I think so yes, [%person#2-first] is a very good manager and both of us are used to handling matches like this, I'm sure his side will be well prepared and we'll see a cracking match on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354660: I think so yes, we're both professionals and are used to dealing with pressure like this, [%person#2-first] is a very good manager and I'm sure his side will be well prepared
KEY-354661: I think so, he's come out of this looking pretty ridiculous as far as I'm concerned. It's always nice to see someone spout nonsense and it blow up in their face and I'm delighted to have shown him up out there
KEY-354662: I think so, especially with the way the game is going in terms of foreign imports. It's important for managers to retain faith in domestic players and [%person#2-first] deserves a lot of credit for the talented home-grown squad he's assembled
KEY-354665: I think that [%person#2-first] is doing an incredible job given the strength of his squad, no disrespect intended but I don't think anyone would have predicted that group of players doing as well as they are and huge credit has to go to [%person#2-first] for that
KEY-354666: I think that [%person#2-first] must have had his tongue firmly in his cheek, I've got a much thicker skin than that and he knows it
KEY-354667: I think that he'll do what's best for his club by accepting that mistakes have been made, apologising and moving on
KEY-354668: I think that a few sides have been guilty of looking at their squad on paper and not taking them seriously, I'd say that they're where they are at the minute thanks to complacency from their recent opponents rather than anything [%person#2] has done especially well
KEY-354669: I think that a few sides have been guilty of underestimating them given their constraints so I'd say that they're where they are at the minute thanks to complacency from their recent opponents rather than anything [%person#2] has done especially well
KEY-354670: I think that all got a bit out of hand. I cleared things up with [%person#2-first] after the match and there is no issue there. I don't think what I said had any influence on the result though, but I was impressed with [%team#2-short] out there
KEY-354672: I think that is a bit unfair on [%person#2-first] to be honest, he is his own person with his own methods and to imply that I've got some kind of influence over that isn't really on
KEY-354674: I think that nerves can sometimes be a useful tool of our trade and a match like this is a good example of that, we should be approaching it knowing how high the stakes are and use any nervousness to ensure the players have full concentration on the task at hand
KEY-354675: I think that nerves can sometimes be a useful tool of our trade and a match like this is a good example of that, we should be approaching it knowing how high the stakes are for the fans and use any nervousness to ensure the players have full concentration on the task at hand
KEY-354676: I think that people are just looking for a stick to beat [%person#2-first] with, his comments had nothing to do with the result, that's not how football works
KEY-354677: I think that ship has already sailed, I'm not thinking about anything other than getting one over on [%person#2] on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354678: I think that ship has already sailed. I'm not thinking about anything other than getting one over on [%person#2] on [%date#1-day], the rivalry between the clubs is one thing but this has turned personal
KEY-354680: I think that's a bit disrespectful to [%person#2-first] to be honest, the idea that he won't already be able to inspire a good performance isn't one that I subscribe to
KEY-354681: I think that's a bit over the top. My preparations for the match will be based on nothing other than football regardless of what I think of [%person#2]
KEY-354682: I think the challenges are more for [%person#2-first] than me, he has to work out a way to get the best out of an ageing squad whereas I can prepare knowing that we can run rings around them for ninety minutes
KEY-354683: I think the ends have justified the means so far. Our record playing this way has been good, don't forget
KEY-354684: I think the fact that [%person#2-first] is still spending time talking about me despite having a victory to celebrate says it all about the mentality of the man and his club to be honest, they will always be in our shadow, one result doesn't change that
KEY-354685: I think the fact that [%person#2-first] is still spending time talking about me despite having a victory to celebrate says it all about the mentality of the man and his club to be honest
KEY-354686: I think the fans are obviously a bit more partisan than us managers for the most part, that doesn't mean I'm not up for the fight though. I'll enjoy getting a win over [%person#2-first] as much as any fan will
KEY-354687: I think the future looks very bright for [%person#2-first] and his side, there is a lot of potential available to him but hopefully we can use that little bit of extra experience we have for a positive result
KEY-354688: I think the match has to be judged on its own merits, we weren't at our best out there but for [%person#2] to claim that his comments had anything to do with that is a bit of a stretch if you ask me
KEY-354689: I think the result speaks for itself in terms of my ability. I don't see it as getting one over on [%person#2-first] though, we had a chat after the match and there are no bad feelings between the two of us
KEY-354691: I think there will still be a bit of an edge in the match if I'm honest, we football managers have a bit of a long memory when it comes to this sort of thing
KEY-354692: I think there's a danger of that, yes. A game of this magnitude can sometimes lead to everybody involved getting a bit overawed. It's my job to try and ensure the pressure doesn't affect performance but it will be a tough task
KEY-354693: I think they did unfortunately, I was hoping my comments would lead to a bit of self-doubt creeping in for [%person#2-first] but it wasn't to be
KEY-354694: I think they're a good example of what happens when you underestimate an opponent, I'd say that they're where they are at the minute thanks to complacency from their recent opposition rather than their own ability if I'm being brutally honest
KEY-354695: I think they're entitled to play however they want to so long as it stays within the laws of the game
KEY-354696: I think they're probably about where I'd expect if I'm being honest, for all the individual talent in the squad they're still not that good as a team at the end of the day and [%person#2-first] is getting exactly the kind of results I'd expect from them
KEY-354697: I think they're probably about where I'd expect if I'm being honest, for all the money they've spent they're still not that good a side at the end of the day and [%person#2-first] is getting exactly the kind of results I'd expect from the players at his disposal
KEY-354698: I think they're probably about where I'd expect if I'm being honest, they're not that good a side at the end of the day and [%person#2-first] is getting exactly the kind of results I'd expect from a team like that
KEY-354699: I think this might be the result that forces [%person#2] into a rethink of his tactics, I knew how to play against him all along and I think a lot of other managers might have seen how to get the better of him as well after this
KEY-354700: I think we both let the magnitude of the match get to us a bit, neither of us covered ourselves in glory with some of our comments but I hope we can move on now. This is a great sporting rivalry and there was no need for it to be focused on anything other than the football, I've got to apologise for my part in that
KEY-354701: I think we both let the magnitude of the match get to us a bit, neither of us covered ourselves in glory with some of our comments but I hope we can move on now
KEY-354702: I think we both need to agree to stop mouthing off in the press about each other if I'm honest, neither of us has behaved with a lot of dignity recently and we both need to put this behind us for the good of our respective clubs
KEY-354703: I think we got away with it if anything, his comments led to a bit of self-doubt going into the match and I'm relieved to have come away with a result despite that
KEY-354704: I think we got away with that a bit today. [%person#2-First] praise seemed to spark a bit of complacency in my lads unfortunately and we nearly came unstuck
KEY-354705: I think we're really starting to show that this is the level we belong at, this run has gone on long enough for people to start believing we're the real deal now
KEY-354706: I think you could say it may have given me and the lads a bit of extra motivation to get a good result but that's as far as it goes really, I've got no issues with [%person#2-first] and I think he'd say the same about me
KEY-354707: I think you guys have blown it out of proportion a bit if I'm honest, [%person#2-first] didn't say anything especially controversial and I'm certainly not going to fuel your stories any more and let it affect our preparation
KEY-354708: I think you guys might be twisting his words a bit, I took them in the complimentary way I believe they were intended, we're doing ok here at the minute and all this talk of underachievement is nonsense as far as I'm concerned
KEY-354709: I think you lot are twisting my words a bit there. I'm confident about my own ability, that doesn't mean I'm being dismissive of [%person#2-first] talent
KEY-354710: I think you lot blew all of that out of proportion a bit, things get said in the heat of the moment sometimes but I've got no problem with [%person#2-first]. That's not to say I'm not entirely focused on getting a positive result though
KEY-354711: I think you lot have read a bit too much into what he said in all honesty. I don't think I have any influence over him at all, let alone one that gives me any footballing advantage
KEY-354712: I think you lot read too much into my comments to be honest. I'm happy with the result but I was always confident, admiring another side isn't the same as admitting defeat to them
KEY-354713: I think you're doing [%person#2-first] a bit of a disservice there, he is thick-skinned enough to not let a bit of criticism affect his performance, the result says more about the quality of my side than the weaknesses of his
KEY-354714: I think you're jumping to conclusions a bit there, all I said was that I was looking forward to it being over, that doesn't mean I'm not confident about our chances
KEY-354715: I think you're jumping to conclusions a bit there, all I said was that I was looking forward to it being over, that doesn't mean I'm not confident about our chances
KEY-354716: I think you're placing a bit too much importance on what gets said in these press conferences. The players know what they have to do and I'm confident they'll be up for the task
KEY-354717: I think you're reading a bit too much into my comments to be honest. I wasn't trying to be critical, you asked for my opinion and I gave it
KEY-354718: I thought I'd apologised to him at the full-time whistle but maybe he didn't hear me so I'd like to take this chance to say I've got no issues at all with him and I really hope we can all move on now
KEY-354719: I thought [%person#2-first] showed a lot of class with his comments after the match. Too often managers look to gloat and get one over on their opponents but [%person#2-surname] showed that doesn't have to be the case today
KEY-354720: I thought [%person#2-first] spoke very intelligently about the benefits of foreign players in his press conference, we obviously share a similar footballing ethos and it should make for a fascinating match on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354721: I thought [%person#2-first] spoke very intelligently about the importance of domestic players in his press conference. We obviously share a similar footballing ethos and it should make for a fascinating match on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354722: I thought it was astonishing actually, you don't often get to see a manager showing such an inferiority complex in the build-up to a match and my lads have been around long enough to know how to capitalise on mental fragility in an opponent
KEY-354723: I thought it was astonishing actually, you don't often get to see a manager showing such an inferiority complex in the build-up to a match and my lads will be itching to get out there and prove him right on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354724: I thought it was astonishing actually, you don't often get to see an opponent showing such an inferiority complex in the build-up to a match and our boys can be very confident of getting a good result after that
KEY-354725: I thought it was astonishing thing to have said, you don't often see a manager showing such an inferiority complex in the build-up to a match and my lads will be desperate to get out there and prove him right on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354726: I thought it was pretty unprofessional to have admitted to that, it's a shame when managers have to stoop to that kind of level to try and get an upper hand. To me it just shows what a lack of confidence he must have in his side to get the job done without this sort of thing
KEY-354727: I thought it was telling that [%person#2-first] pointed the finger at his side today and it shows how well we frustrated them, it's something we'll need to do a lot more of if we're going to get out of this mess
KEY-354728: I thought it was telling that [%person#2-first] pointed the finger at his side today and it shows how well we frustrated them, it's something we've done a number of times now and it's one of the main reasons we're doing so well
KEY-354729: I thought it was unprofessional of [%person#2-first] to be criticising a fellow manager like that, it's not as if his side are setting the world on fire with their football either is it really?
KEY-354731: I thought it was very unprofessional for [%person#2] to have said that, we're ready to teach him a lesson in respect on [%date#1-day] regardless of how well we're doing at the minute
KEY-354732: I thought it was very unprofessional for [%person#2] to have written us off like that, we're ready to show him that we're the real deal with a good result on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354733: I took [%person#2-first] comments as advice rather than criticism and appreciated it. In our job we have to constantly adapt and develop the way we approach matches and I'm looking forward to testing myself against [%person#2-first]
KEY-354734: I took [%person#2-first] comments in the complimentary way that I think they were intended. I certainly don't think it gives us any advantage or anything though. He has a great set of players too and it should be a really good match
KEY-354735: I took his comments with a pinch of salt to be honest, I think he is probably looking to give his side some extra motivation with his comments
KEY-354736: I try and approach every match in the same way regardless of the perceived importance of it, we'll be focused on our own game and getting a good result
KEY-354737: I try to develop my approach all the time regardless of what anyone has said about me. I'm going into every match more experienced than the one before and this is no different at all
KEY-354738: I try to focus more on the way my team plays than the opposition, we'll concentrate on our own game and hopefully we can get a positive result regardless of [%person#2-first] style
KEY-354739: I was always confident we could get a good result out there and I'm delighted that it's proven to be the case, I have to say I was impressed with the way [%person#2-first] tried to get his side into the match though
KEY-354740: I was angry about what [%person#2] said then and I'm still angry about it now, it was totally unprofessional of him and has made this match personal. I can't wait to beat him and show everybody what I can do
KEY-354741: I was disappointed to hear him commenting on my position here at all to be honest, the only pressure I'm under is coming as a result of all of these external remarks. The board have full confidence in me as far as I'm concerned and [%person#2-surname] needs to mind his own business
KEY-354742: I was disappointed with the performance of some of the lads and [%person#2-first] comments might just force a few of them to consider if they've got what it takes to perform in this competition
KEY-354743: I was disappointed with the performance of some of the lads and [%person#2-first] comments might just force a few of them to consider if they've still got what it takes to perform at this level
KEY-354744: I was disappointed with the performance of some of the lads and they should be using [%person#2-first] comments as motivation to improve themselves because some of them are letting themselves and the club down at the minute and I won't put up with it much longer
KEY-354745: I was hoping my comments would spark a bit of complacency from him before the match and it looks like it worked given the lethargic and predictable performance they put in out there
KEY-354746: I was impressed by [%team#2] today, as poor as we were they still put in an excellent performance to capitalise on our shortcomings and I think [%person#2-first] deserves a lot more credit than I gave him before the match
KEY-354747: I was impressed by [%team#2] today, as poor as we were they still put in an excellent performance to capitalise on our shortcomings and I think [%person#2-first] deserves a lot of credit for turning things round there
KEY-354748: I was surprised by [%person#2-first] comments, this is a match the fans want their teams to be giving everything in and it looks to me like he might not be up for the fight
KEY-354749: I was surprised by [%person#2-first] comments, this isn't going to be a match for the faint-hearted and it looks to me like he might not be up for the fight
KEY-354750: I was surprised by just how right I was in the build-up frankly, I knew that their recent performances were reflective of their actual ability and we proved that today by ensuring they won't be turning things around any time soon
KEY-354751: I was surprised by just how right I was in the build-up frankly, I knew that their recent performances weren't reflective of their actual ability and we proved that today by sending them back down to earth with a bump
KEY-354752: I was surprised to hear that from [%person#2-first] in all honesty and I have to say I think it shows a bit of mental fragility on his part which we will be keen to exploit on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354753: I was surprised to hear that from him actually. It almost sounded like he doesn't think his side know how to beat my lot and I'm inclined to agree with him if so
KEY-354754: I was very appreciative of [%person#2-first] support in his press conference and think he got it spot on regarding the high turnover of managers currently, that's not to say I'll go easy on him on [%date#1-day] though and I'm confident we can get a good result
KEY-354755: I was very appreciative of [%person#2-first] support in his press conference, it's always a boost to know that your fellow professionals support you, that's not to say I'll go easy on him on [%date#1-day] though and I'm confident we can get a good result
KEY-354758: I wasn't even aware that that's what it was. You lot in the press must think we are pretty thin-skinned if you think either of us are actually affected by it all
KEY-354759: I wasn't even aware that there was a war of words. You lot in the press must think we are pretty thin-skinned if you think either of us are actually affected by it all
KEY-354760: I won't begrudge any manager playing their own style of football but it perhaps falls upon [%person#2] to consider the long-term damage his approach may have
KEY-354761: I would have shaken his hand if he'd offered it to me but once again he's only giving one side of the story in an attempt to drag my name through the mud
KEY-354765: I would rather we just focused on the game itself really, I'm disappointed to have not got the result we were looking for out there but hopefully we can put all this behind us and move on now
KEY-354767: I wouldn't call any game of football a grudge match, no, this just reeks of the media trying to stir up issues that aren't there
KEY-354768: I wouldn't call it dismissive, I just think [%team#2] need to be judged on the squad they have now, not on past glories or reputations. Given their current state I'd say [%person#2-first] is doing ok
KEY-354769: I wouldn't call it stubbornness, I just have confidence in my game plan and in the ability of my squad, there's nothing wrong with that
KEY-354770: I wouldn't say I was shocked, [%person#2-first] is a fantastic manager who deserves his recent success but I'm always confident we can get a result against any side if we're at our best and the boys did me proud today
KEY-354771: I wouldn't say that, no. It just means we'll have to do our homework and make sure we know all about our opponents, if we can do that and put in a good performance I'm confident we can get a good result
KEY-354772: I wouldn't say that. I'm sure [%person#2-first] has only been speaking about it because you lot asked him about it, it's all in the past as far as I'm concerned
KEY-354773: I wouldn't say that; at the end of the day it was a club decision to accept [%team#2-short] bid
KEY-354774: I'd be amazed if he kept his job for much longer after that, before the match I was very supportive of him but his side were very poor today and I don't think I can honestly say he deserves to stay at [%team#2] now
KEY-354775: I'd be lying if I said the added weight of expectation from the fans didn't cause a few extra nerves ahead of a match like this, it's one of those matches where the fear of losing can outweigh the joy of winning and we have to manage our nerves as best we can
KEY-354776: I'd be lying if I said there weren't a few extra nerves ahead of the match. We have to hope we can manage them as best we can
KEY-354777: I'd like to think so but unfortunately I'm not that optimistic about our chances, we're really in the mire at the minute and while this was a good result, it doesn't automatically mean we're out of trouble
KEY-354778: I'd love a chance to work with the calibre of young players that [%person#2-first] has available to him, the talent and determination they have to play first-team football is an example that I hope one or two of my younger lads are learning from
KEY-354779: I'd prefer to focus on the match itself rather than what was or wasn't said before it. I'm pleased with the result and that's the most important thing
KEY-354780: I'd rather focus on the match itself than anything that's been said, we got a great result today and we're very happy with it
KEY-354785: I'd rather focus on the match itself than what people have or haven't been saying really, we need to put an end to this current run and all my energy is focused on that
KEY-354788: I'd rather focus on what went wrong in the match itself than on anything that has or hasn't been said if I'm honest
KEY-354790: I'm a big advocate of foreign talent personally and I think people like [%person#2-surname] are holding the game back in this country by failing to capitalise on the new styles and cultures that come along with imported players
KEY-354791: I'm a big fan of the way [%person#2-first] has got his side playing, it makes them very tough to play against and we will have to make sure we've got the fitness required to press them for long periods of the game
KEY-354792: I'm a big fan of the way [%person#2-first] has got [%team#2] playing, they are a great team to watch at the minute but I'm hoping we can find a way to stop them on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354793: I'm a bit fed up of hearing about how good they are to be honest, it's about time someone showed them up as the overrated side that they are and I really hope we can be the ones to do it
KEY-354794: I'm a little taken aback by it I have to admit. I was really worrying about how we'd cope with the players [%person#2-first] has at his disposal before the match but I learnt a lot about how good my boys can be out there
KEY-354796: I'm absolutely delighted with the result. [%person#2-first] and his side were on a real high and we had to be at our best to get anything from the match. I'm proud of the performance my boys put in
KEY-354797: I'm afraid he might be right, we just can't buy a result at the minute and things are looking increasingly bad for us. I'm trying to remain upbeat but it's becoming harder and harder given the circumstances
KEY-354798: I'm afraid that despite all of [%person#2-first] support over the last few days, his comments may be falling on deaf ears. We really needed a result out there and, I have to say, I've not got much confidence that I'll be facing him again as [%team#1] boss
KEY-354799: I'm amazed we didn't get a win out there. Before the match I was vocal in my support for [%person#2] but I wasn't at all impressed with his side today. They're in a lot more of a mess than I thought and, this result aside, I can't see him turning things around any time soon
KEY-354800: I'm amazed we didn't get a win out there. Before the match, I was very complimentary about the work [%person#2-first] has done but their performance today was very ordinary and I'm stunned things didn't go our way. I can see them falling away pretty soon based on what I saw out there
KEY-354801: I'm angry, not as much with the result, but with the manner of it. I hope the players are hurting and itching to get back on track because I know the fans will be and they are the ones we let down the most
KEY-354802: I'm astonished by [%person#2] lack of professionalism, but we'll never back down from a fight and you can rest assured his boys will know they've been in a match come full-time
KEY-354804: I'm confident that I'm a better manager than [%person#2]. If that makes me sound jealous I'm not worried, we'll see who's laughing come the final whistle on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354805: I'm delighted to have got the better of [%person#2-first]. I was hoping my comments might make his side start believing their own hype and that's exactly what happened, they got complacent and we capitalised on that
KEY-354806: I'm delighted with the result and the performance of the lads. They all knew how important this match was and they really rose to the occasion
KEY-354807: I'm delighted with the result and the performance of the lads. They all knew how important this match was to the fans and they really rose to the occasion and sent them home with the bragging rights
KEY-354808: I'm disappointed with how things went on the pitch but glad to have got the chance to have a word with [%person#2-first] after the match. He's a credit to his club but I'm looking forward to getting a result against him next time around
KEY-354809: I'm disgusted with them and particularly [%person#2]. Their style of play has no place in football
KEY-354810: I'm expecting you lot to whip everyone up into another frenzy and repeat this nonsense in a few weeks or so
KEY-354811: I'm extremely aware of [%male#3-first] and have been impressed with his recent performances
KEY-354812: I'm far from impressed with the way he has conducted [%person#2-himself] in the last few days and for him to be trying to cool things down now doesn't ring true to me at all. It says it all about the mentality at that club if I'm honest
KEY-354813: I'm far from impressed with the way he has conducted [%person#2-himself] in the last few days and for him to be trying to cool things down now doesn't ring true to me at all
KEY-354815: I'm firmly of the opinion that patience in football will be rewarded. The turnover of managers at the minute is getting ridiculous and I'd urge the board at [%team#2] to give [%person#2-first] more time because he's a very capable manager
KEY-354819: I'm infuriated by the failure of my lads to get the job done today. [%team#2] were there for the taking and I still maintain that [%person#2-surname] is a very average manager. The players let me down today, unfortunately
KEY-354821: I'm just amazed by his unprofessionalism. We managers are meant to stick together when it comes to this sort of thing and to hear him continuing to stick the knife in, even though we got the result today, says it all about him, frankly
KEY-354822: I'm just amazed that anybody still holds those views. I think everyone can see that foreign players have had a wonderful influence on the standard of football here and they're ready to show [%person#2-surname] just how wrong he is on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354823: I'm just disappointed with my team today. I felt like we could have got a result out there with a better performance and hearing [%person#2] gloating like this just makes it all the more galling
KEY-354824: I'm just disappointed with my team today. I felt like we could have got a result out there with a better performance and hearing [%person#2] talking about what a good result it was for him just makes it all the more galling
KEY-354825: I'm just disappointed with the way my lads performed out there. We could have got a good result with the right application levels despite all of [%person#2-surname] recent success but they let themselves and me down today
KEY-354826: I'm just expressing surprise more than anything. [%person#2-first] is a good manager but his recent success is not something I personally saw coming
KEY-354827: I'm just focused on the match itself. The lads are all well up for the fight and we're well prepared and confident of getting a result
KEY-354828: I'm just focusing on what went wrong in footballing terms and I don't see any benefit in discussing anything that was said in the build-up to the match
KEY-354829: I'm just looking forward to the match. There will never be a better time to play [%team#2] as they look bereft of confidence. [%person#2-first] is going to need a miracle to keep his job once we've finished with them
KEY-354833: I'm just worried that it's getting to the stage where people are expecting a bit too much from us. I'm very aware that this good run might not last and it's becoming increasingly difficult to manage expectations given all this praise
KEY-354834: I'm more relieved than anything else. I'm pleased with the result but I'm looking forward to a less stressful week now!
KEY-354835: I'm more relieved than anything else. I'm pleased with the result but I'm looking forward to a less stressful week now. These matches are great for the fans but they can be an absolute nightmare for the managers
KEY-354836: I'm more than happy to face up to criticism, but I would stress that the focus needs to be beyond the next game. I am looking to establish something far greater
KEY-354837: I'm not a fan of [%person#2-first] playing style at all. This is meant to be the beautiful game and he does his best to knock the excitement out of every match, it just makes me all the more determined to get a positive result
KEY-354838: I'm not a fan of his style of football. The way they bypass their midfield belongs in the past as far as I'm concerned. I'm confident we can get a positive result and with a more attractive style at that
KEY-354839: I'm not a fan of it. There's being assertive and then there's [%team#2-short]; they've left their mark on [%male#3-first] and he won't be the first nor last to suffer
KEY-354840: I'm not at all surprised really, he's always struck me as someone who is only out for [%person#2-himself]. It's fine though, it'll just make it all the sweeter when we beat them on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354841: I'm not at all worried about that and I'm fully confident that we can get a good result against a team playing the kind of football [%person#2] insists on
KEY-354842: I'm not being disrespectful by supporting a fellow professional. The game has got out of hand with the high turnover of managers recently and we've all got to stick together to show the decision makers that it's not right
KEY-354843: I'm not being harsh at all. Nobody could look at their recent performances and claim they should be higher than they are. When are people going to start judging teams on results rather than reputations?
KEY-354844: I'm not being harsh at all. Nobody could say that the results they've been getting have been anything other than shocks, as such you've got to ask questions about the level of their opponents in those matches
KEY-354846: I'm not concerned at all really, we all have jobs to do and we're just going to have to get on with things
KEY-354848: I'm not even going to dignify that with an answer. Ask me that again after the match and you'll see if I've got an inferiority complex
KEY-354849: I'm not even going to dignify that with an answer. I don't know why you lot in the press can't just focus on what happens on the pitch to be honest
KEY-354852: I'm not going to apologise for expressing an opinion and I certainly don't accept that he is more forward thinking than me. It's all the rage to rely on foreign talent at the minute so you could even argue that I'm leading the way in battling against that trend
KEY-354853: I'm not going to discuss what was said. We've both got more important things to be worrying about than any alleged feud that you guys can't seem to let drop
KEY-354854: I'm not hiding the fact it will be a tough match given how [%person#2-first] has got them playing but that doesn't mean I don't think we can get a good result
KEY-354855: I'm not holding my breath but at least I can come out of this with my head held high knowing that I've taken the moral high ground
KEY-354856: I'm not in awe at all, I think his side plays good football but I know my side plays better
KEY-354857: I'm not interested in discussing [%person#2] comments. I'd much rather focus on the match itself and I'm very happy with the performance of the lads
KEY-354858: I'm not interested in discussing [%person#2] comments. I'd much rather focus on the match itself and I'm very happy with the performance of the lads
KEY-354859: I'm not interested in discussing a match that is done and dusted now. We're focusing on what's ahead of us
KEY-354861: I'm not letting myself get too carried away. [%person#2-first] will be a tough opponent but I'm confident we can get a good result and send the fans home with the bragging rights
KEY-354862: I'm not letting myself get too carried away. [%person#2-first] will be a tough opponent but I'm confident we can get a good result
KEY-354863: I'm not paying them the slightest bit of attention if I'm honest. We're all focusing on what lies ahead for the club
KEY-354864: I'm not paying too much attention to all that really. [%person#2-first] is probably just trying to play a few mind games to give his side an advantage
KEY-354865: I'm not paying too much attention to it if I'm honest. We know we need to turn things around and we're all very confident that we can start on [%date#1-day] against [%person#2] and his side
KEY-354866: I'm not playing anything down. What [%person#2] has had to say is of no concern to me, we've got the result we wanted and he hasn't, we can move on to the next match while he licks his wounds
KEY-354867: I'm not prepared to discuss the balance of my squad at this stage. Ask me something about the match itself instead
KEY-354868: I'm not so sure about that. We got a bit lucky out there and it has made me wonder if [%person#2-first] was right and we might need one or two more experienced players after all
KEY-354869: I'm not so sure about that. We got a bit lucky out there and it has made me wonder if [%person#2-first] was right and we might need to freshen things up in the squad with some more home-grown players
KEY-354870: I'm not so sure about that. We got a bit lucky out there and it has made me wonder if [%person#2-first] was right and we might need to freshen things up in the squad with some talent from a bit further afield than we're used to
KEY-354871: I'm not so sure about that. We got a bit lucky out there and it has made me wonder if [%person#2-first] was right and we might need to move a few of the older lads on and freshen things up in the squad
KEY-354872: I'm not sure but the ball is in his court now so I guess we'll wait and see if he can swallow his pride this time
KEY-354873: I'm not sure really. I approached the match in the same way I would any other game so his comments didn't fire me up more or anything like that. I think his side are more responsible than he is, personally
KEY-354874: I'm not sure that it did at all really. [%person#2-first] and I had a chat after the match and cleared a few things up, I'm very pleased with the result and we can all move on now
KEY-354875: I'm not sure that's the case really. You lot always try to turn everything into a crisis these days, if the club's reputation is starting to suffer then someone needs to tell the fans, who were magnificent in their support for their side today
KEY-354876: I'm not sure there's much we can do. [%team#2-short] are playing as they see fit and it's up to everybody else to find a way of dealing with it
KEY-354877: I'm not surprised by his comments as he's right. I am lucky to have such a talented crop at the club but I have to make sure they don't get carried away with the praise and avoid complacency on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354878: I'm not surprised by his comments as he's right. I am lucky to have such an experienced and talented set of players at the club and I'm confident they've got enough about them to not let his praise lead to any complacency on their part
KEY-354879: I'm not surprised that [%person#2-surname] tried to gain an advantage with mind games like that. I'm very happy to see it backfire though, his unprofessionalism pretty much gave my team-talk for me
KEY-354880: I'm not surprised, but it's well overdue
KEY-354881: I'm not too concerned really. These big matches have to be judged in isolation and I don't think it will have too much of an impact on the squad
KEY-354882: I'm not too concerned really. These kind of big matches have to be judged in isolation and I don't think it will have too much of an impact on the squad. It affects the fans more really and I'm disappointed to have been unable to give them the bragging rights
KEY-354883: I'm not underestimating him at all, maybe he is underestimating [%person#2-himself] but I'm not expecting anything other than a tough match on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354886: I'm still amazed we didn't come away with a good result today. I thought [%team#2] were very ordinary but we were even worse. We'll look back at this as a missed opportunity once they inevitably start to fall away in the coming weeks
KEY-354887: I'm still amazed we didn't come away with a good result today. I thought [%team#2] were very ordinary but we were even worse. [%person#2-surname] still has a real job on his hands as far as I'm concerned
KEY-354888: I'm sure [%person#2-first] was just answering your questions. You lot always try to stir this kind of thing up, I'm trying to ignore it and focus on getting a result from our next match
KEY-354890: I'm surprised that you seem so willing to ignore the personal battle. Do you not think the fans might want to see a bit more fight from you?
KEY-354891: I'm surprised to hear you speaking like that, is it not a little dismissive of a side with a reputation like [%team#2] to suggest that their current performance levels are ok when all the evidence suggests otherwise?
KEY-354892: I'm surprised to hear that from [%person#2-first], and I think he might just be trying to save face. His praise of my squad was appreciated before the match and proven right during it
KEY-354893: I'm surprised you even need to ask that question. [%person#2-first] embarrassed [%person#2-himself] before the match by trying to faze me and I left him licking his wounds
KEY-354894: I'm too focused on working out what went wrong in footballing terms to be wasting time commenting about what [%person#2] has said or not said. We let our fans down today and I've got to make sure we rectify that as soon as possible
KEY-354895: I'm too focused on working out what went wrong in footballing terms to be wasting time commenting about what [%person#2] has said or not said. We let our fans down today and need to rectify that as soon as we can
KEY-354896: I'm too focused on working out what went wrong in footballing terms to be wasting time commenting about what [%person#2] has said or not said
KEY-354897: I'm very appreciative of [%person#2-first] congratulatory comments. It's always special coming from a manager you admire and he certainly fits that bill, I'm looking forward to a drink with him after the match regardless of the result
KEY-354898: I'm very concerned. It's going to get gradually worse if nothing is done to prevent these teams from assaulting their opponents
KEY-354900: I'm very grateful to [%person#2-first] for his comments. It's not been a great few days given all the speculation and the fact he took the time to speak out in support of me means a lot
KEY-354901: I'm very happy that the lads have put him in his place. They were all itching to get a good result and prove what they can do after he questioned them so publically and I couldn't be prouder that they've proved him wrong
KEY-354902: I'm very happy that they have put him in his place. They were all itching to get a good result and prove that they've still got it after he questioned them so publically and I couldn't be happier that they've proved him wrong
KEY-354903: I'm very happy that they have put him in his place. They were all itching to get a good result and prove that they've still got it after he questioned them so publically and I couldn't be happier that they've proved him wrong
KEY-354904: I'm very happy with the result and it was great to get a chance to thank [%person#2-first] for his kind words after the match. He's a fantastic manager whose team were a credit to him today despite the result
KEY-354905: I'm very happy with the result, it backs up what I was saying before the match. I feel vindicated and hopefully my side will start getting some deserved plaudits for the way we play now
KEY-354906: I'm very happy. The lads were all aware of the extra pressure on them but they used it to spur them on to a great performance and sent the fans home happy
KEY-354907: I'm very happy. The lads were all aware of what was at stake for these fans but they used the added sense of expectation to spur them on to a great performance and sent the fans home happy
KEY-354908: I'm very pleased with the result. I still maintain that [%person#2-first] side play excellent football and I'm delighted to have matched them out there
KEY-354910: I've been looking forward to a chance to finally put [%person#2] in his place. He showed what kind of a person he is last time around and we're all focused on inflicting a humiliating defeat on him
KEY-354911: I've been made to eat my words. I wasn't at all convinced by [%person#2-first] side before the match but they showed they're the real deal with their performance today and I think they can go from strength to strength
KEY-354912: I've been made to eat my words. I wasn't at all convinced by [%person#2-first] side before the match but they've shown that results can be deceptive sometimes and I think [%person#2-first] will get them back on track now
KEY-354913: I've been watching [%team#2] with a bit of amusement in recent weeks. They've been a shambles at the back and we're looking forward to racking up a big score against them
KEY-354914: I've got better things to do than engage in that tired debate
KEY-354915: I've got no intention of accepting his apology. I'm not a fan of him and no amount of grovelling is going to change that
KEY-354917: I've got no interest in discussing anything he has or hasn't said. We've got another great result and we can move on with a lot of confidence from it
KEY-354918: I've got no interest in discussing anything he has or hasn't said. We've got to focus on what went wrong in a footballing sense and work hard on making sure it doesn't happen again
KEY-354919: I've got no interest in discussing anything [%person#2] has had to say. I'm just focused on [%team#1] and trying to win football matches with them
KEY-354920: I've got no interest in discussing anything [%person#2] has or hasn't had to say. I'm just focused on [%team#1] and trying to win football matches with them
KEY-354921: I've got no problem at all with a difference of opinion and he expressed [%person#2-himself] very well but he's probably given my team talk for me frankly. The lads will be desperate to get out there and prove a point now
KEY-354922: I've got nothing to worry about. I'm confident that I've done nothing wrong and I can come out of all this with my head held high
KEY-354923: I've got to admit I got it a bit wrong before the match and, despite the result, [%person#2-first] home-grown lads proved they've got plenty about them out there today
KEY-354924: I've got to admit I got it a bit wrong before the match and, despite the result, [%person#2-first] imports proved they've got plenty about them out there today
KEY-354925: I've got to admit I got it a bit wrong before the match and, despite the result, [%person#2-first] old-guard proved they've still got plenty about them out there today
KEY-354926: I've got to admit that I did embellish that a little bit to get you guys off my back. It was wrong of me and I apologise for it. It wasn't behaviour befitting of a manager and I now realise that
KEY-354927: I've got to admit that it was very petty of me and I apologise for it. It wasn't behaviour befitting of a manager and I now realise that
KEY-354928: I've got to be honest, I think [%person#2-surname] gets a bit of a free pass in the press sometimes purely because he has home-grown players. If people opened their eyes they'd see that he's actually got a fairly average bunch and maybe some foreign imports could help
KEY-354929: I've got to be honest, I think [%person#2-surname] is a bit overrated. It was a surprise to me to see his recent achievement and I think we can get a good result against his side on [%date#1-day] to highlight his shortcomings
KEY-354931: I've got to hold my hands up and say I got it wrong. I was very impressed with [%person#2-first] side during the match and he was a class act afterwards as well
KEY-354933: I've got to say I'm amazed we didn't win that match. I was supportive of [%person#2-surname] in the build-up but I thought they were very poor today, despite the result, and I don't think he'll last much longer
KEY-354935: I've got to say my comments backfired a bit, I was hoping my praise would act as me throwing the gauntlet down to my lads but unfortunately they couldn't rise to the task on this occasion
KEY-354936: I've got to say my comments backfired. I was hoping my praise would be like me throwing the gauntlet down to my lads but unfortunately they couldn't rise to the task on this occasion
KEY-354937: I've got to say that his words did give us a bit of extra motivation. Everyone was desperate to prove him wrong and I'm delighted to have made him eat his words
KEY-354942: I've heard it all now! No, I don't think it could be seen as an inferiority complex, [%person#2-first] is a good manager but I think I'm better
KEY-354945: My comments were geared around ensuring a good performance from my lads rather than affecting [%person#2-first] and his preparation. His boys were good today and he's obviously doing a good job but we got the job done out there and I'm pleased with the result
KEY-354946: My comments were geared around ensuring a good performance from my lads rather than affecting [%person#2-first] and his preparation. His boys were good today and he's obviously got a good chance of turning things around but we got the job done out there and I'm pleased with the result
KEY-354947: My opinion of [%person#2-first] has gone up a lot since the match. He handled [%person#2-himself] very well during and after the match and I've got no problem with him at all but the rivalry between the clubs is still as fierce as ever though
KEY-354948: My opinion of [%person#2-first] has gone up a lot since the match. He handled [%person#2-himself] very well during and after the match and I've got no problem with him at all
KEY-354950: My stance on the matter hasn't changed at all, [%person#2-first] is a great manager and his team were a credit to him today as they tried to get back into the match. The results will come for him if his board are patient
KEY-354951: My team let me down today unfortunately. They were even poorer than [%person#2-surname] lot today which says it all. I still think the board at [%team#2] would be mad to keep him at the club, though
KEY-354952: You had harsh words for [%person#2] and his side before the match. Do you think they had any impact on things going in your favour out there today?
KEY-354953: You must be disappointed with a result like that in such an important match for your fans. How much does it mean to you and how do you think your team will react?
KEY-354954: You must be disappointed with a result like that in such an important match. How much does it mean to you and how do you think your team will react?
KEY-354955: You must feel even better about the result given you've got one over on [%person#2] after your pre-match war of words. What does this say about your ability under pressure compared to him?
KEY-354956: You must feel even better about the result given the pre-match war of words between [%person#2] and yourself, is it fair to say that the exchange gave you a bit of extra motivation?
KEY-354958: You seem to be treating this result with quite a blasé attitude. Do you think that your lack of passion for the big rivalry compared to [%person#2] could have had something to do with the defeat?
KEY-354959: You seem very confident about your own ability to handle pressure compared to [%person#2]. Is there a danger you might be underestimating him?
KEY-354960: You sound like you're worried about the strength of opposition on [%date#1-day], is it fair to say you think [%person#2-surname] side have the advantage over you?
KEY-354961: You're being refreshingly honest here but isn't there a danger of your criticism inspiring a better performance from [%person#2-surname] and his side?
KEY-354962: You're obviously very surprised by their current performance levels, is there a danger of [%person#2] and his side finding your praise a little patronising though?
KEY-354963: Your comments about [%person#2] playing style certainly seemed to have backfired a bit given the result out there. Will you think twice before criticising an opponent before a match again?
KEY-354964: Your encounter with [%team#2] on [%date#1-day] sees you come up against a jubilant [%person#2] following his recent [%award#1] win. How do you feel about your counterpart's recent achievement?
KEY-354965: Your encounter with [%team#2] on [%date#1-day] sees you come up against a jubilant [%person#2] given he has managed to steer his side clear of relegation. How do you feel about your counterpart's recent achievement?
KEY-354966: Your encounter with [%team#2] on [%date#1-day] sees you come up against a jubilant [%person#2] given his recent continental qualification success. How do you feel about your counterpart's recent achievement?
KEY-354967: Your encounter with [%team#2] on [%date#1-day] sees you come up against a jubilant [%person#2] given his recent cup win. How do you feel about your counterpart's recent achievement?
KEY-354968: Your encounter with [%team#2] on [%date#1-day] sees you come up against a jubilant [%person#2] given his recent promotion. How do you feel about your counterpart's recent achievement?
KEY-354969: Your encounter with [%team#2] on [%date#1-day] sees you come up against a jubilant [%person#2] given his title triumph. How do you feel about your counterpart's recent achievement?
KEY-354972: Your response seems to suggest an unwillingness to adapt your tactics despite the variations of footballing styles you're faced with. Is there a danger that your stubbornness could see you come unstuck?
KEY-354973: Your support for [%person#2-surname] is all well and good but ultimately the results don't lie. How long can you say he deserves to keep his job if performances don't improve?
KEY-354975: He does have a way of winding me up but I'm trying to not let it affect me or my team
KEY-354976: He has definitely got under my skin but all that it's going to achieve is a more fired up opponent for him on [%date#1-day] and we're going to come out on top
KEY-354977: He is just someone I have absolutely no time for. The way he's behaved in recent matches between us has made any attempts to take the moral high ground absolutely impossible. I'd be very happy to see the back of him if I'm honest
KEY-354981: He's entitled to his opinion at the end of the day, it doesn't make any difference to me what he says though. We've got to focus on getting back on track and finding the form that has brought me such success lately
KEY-354982: He's entitled to his opinion but I don't agree with it. We're looking to improve with every match and I think the signs are there that we're starting to turn a corner. Hopefully a good result against [%team#2] on [%date#1-day] can give us the boost we need
KEY-354983: He's entitled to his opinion but I don't agree with it. We're where we are because we've performed fantastically and prepared for every match properly. [%date#1-day] encounter will be no different and we're looking forward to proving him wrong
KEY-354984: He's given my team talk for me really. His comments will provide that bit of extra motivation we may have needed to get a much needed result on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354985: He's given my team talk for me really. His comments will provide that bit of extra motivation we may have needed to get a result on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354986: You must be happy with that result especially given the importance of the match to both sets of fans. How pleased are you with your side given the magnitude of the match?
KEY-354987: You must be pleased with the result given the importance of the match to both clubs. How pleased are you with your side given the magnitude of the match?
KEY-354988: [%person#2-first] and I are very different characters and I don't think we're ever going to be inviting each other round for dinner or anything like that but I appreciated him setting a few things straight and that's the end of it as far as I'm concerned
KEY-354989: [%person#2-first] gets a lot of stick for the way he sets his teams out and I've always thought that was unfair. The defensive side of the game is every bit as important as the more glamorous attacking aspects and we'll be in for a tough task trying to break his side down
KEY-354990: [%person#2-first] got complacent, all the praise started to go to his head and the performance showed that. I knew that the moment they stopped considering themselves underdogs would be the moment they dropped off and that's proven to be the case
KEY-354991: [%person#2-first] has his own way of managing his team and I've got mine. I don't think for one minute that he lacks passion though, you don't get far in this job without it
KEY-354992: [%person#2-first] has his own way of playing the game and it's certainly easy on the eye. I'm confident that I've got a plan to stop them though and if we play a sensible game we can get a positive result
KEY-354993: [%person#2-first] has assembled a squad with a lot of know-how and deserves a lot of credit for that. We'll need to be at our best to get a positive result against a side as experienced as [%team#2]
KEY-354995: [%person#2-first] has got his side keeping the ball incredibly well. We're going to have to work hard to make sure we make it count when we do have the ball or we'll be in for a long match
KEY-354996: [%person#2-first] has got a good result today but he still has a lot of hard work on his plate, it's too early to say he's out of the woods yet
KEY-354997: [%person#2-first] has got a wonderful squad at his disposal and I think their results have been a bit deceptive lately. He's actually doing a pretty good job as far as I'm concerned, we'll have to be at our very best to get anything out of the match on [%date#1-day] because their poor run won't last forever
KEY-354998: [%person#2-first] has got every right to express his opinion, it doesn't affect me though. We're confident in our approach and hope it can be effective on [%date#1-day]
KEY-354999: [%person#2-first] is a bit deluded if he actually thinks that. I thrive on pressure like this and fancy myself to have the beating of him on [%date#1-day]
KEY-355001: [%person#2-first] is a fantastic defensive tactician and it will be a challenge to break his side down. It's a challenge that I relish though and hopefully we can find a way to get a positive result
KEY-355002: [%person#2-first] is a good manager and I always pay attention to what my fellow professionals say whether it's positive or negative. I think all this talk of underachievement has been pretty helpful in motivating us to turn things around and I'm delighted with the result today
KEY-355003: [%person#2-first] is a good manager and someone I've got a lot of time for but I try not to pay attention to what anyone says in the build-up to matches and this was no different. His comments didn't affect our approach at all
KEY-355004: [%person#2-first] is a great manager with great passion for his team, I think you lot in the media have been a bit harsh on him since our match to be honest
KEY-355005: [%person#2-first] is a manager I look up to and I have to admit he might have a point. Some of the older lads looked a yard or two off the pace out there and it might be time to freshen things up a bit in the transfer window
KEY-355006: [%person#2-first] is a manager I look up to and I have to admit he might have a point. We might need a few foreign players in the squad to give us a few different options to allow us to switch things up a bit from time to time, it's something I'll look to address
KEY-355007: [%person#2-first] is a manager I look up to and I have to admit he might have a point. We might need a few home-grown players in the squad to help the foreign lads out from time to time and it might be time to add one or two domestic players in the transfer window
KEY-355008: [%person#2-first] is a manager I look up to and I have to admit he might have a point. We've got a very talented bunch of lads here but we might be one or two experienced players away from something special and I'll be looking to bring a couple in if I can
KEY-355009: [%person#2-first] is a manager who I respect so it's certainly something I'll have a think about, perhaps I need to work on having a plan B for when things aren't going our way
KEY-355010: [%person#2-first] is a very good manager and there's a lot I can learn from him in terms of handling occasions like this. I'm looking forward to the experience of testing myself against him
KEY-355011: [%person#2-first] is a very good manager and there's a lot I can learn from him in terms of handling occasions like this. I'm looking forward to the experience of testing myself in a high-pressured situation against one of the best in the business
KEY-355012: [%person#2-first] is doing a wonderful job in very difficult conditions at [%team#2] especially given the financial restrictions of the club. He deserves a lot of credit because I don't think anyone could have predicted how well he's done
KEY-355013: [%person#2-first] is entitled to his opinion but I don't agree with it. We're in this position on merit, we've put in some fantastic performances recently, none more so than today, and I'm very proud of the lads
KEY-355014: [%person#2-first] is entitled to his opinion but I still have a lot of faith in my lads. There is a lot of foreign quality in my squad and one result doesn't change that. These players have a lot to offer
KEY-355015: [%person#2-first] is entitled to his opinion but I still have a lot of faith in my lads. There is a lot of great quality in my squad and one result doesn't mean I'm suddenly going to start looking abroad for my players
KEY-355016: [%person#2-first] is entitled to his opinion but I still have a lot of faith in my lads. There is a real wealth of experience in my squad and one result doesn't change that. These players still have a lot to offer
KEY-355018: [%person#2-first] is entitled to his opinion but I think a performance like that from my lads goes a long way in proving why he got it wrong. They're a very talented and experienced bunch and I'm confident they can keep this level of performance up
KEY-355019: [%person#2-first] is entitled to his opinion but I think a performance like that from my lads goes a long way in proving why he got it wrong. They're a very talented bunch and I'm confident they can bring success to this club
KEY-355020: [%person#2-first] is entitled to his opinion but I think a performance like that from my lads goes a long way in proving why he got it wrong. They're a very talented bunch and I'm confident they can continue to show that managers don't need to immediately look abroad for quality players
KEY-355021: [%person#2-first] is entitled to his opinion but I think a performance like that from my lads goes a long way in proving why he got it wrong. They're a very talented bunch and I'm confident they can continue to show what they can do in this country
KEY-355023: [%person#2-first] is entitled to his opinion but it's like water off a duck's back to me. I'm just making sure we're well prepared to put an end to this run of bad form against his side so we can put an end to this speculation
KEY-355024: [%person#2-first] is entitled to express his opinions. I'm not that fussed if I'm honest, the result speaks for itself
KEY-355025: [%person#2-first] is just trying to provoke a reaction but he won't get one from me. He is entitled to his opinion and it doesn't bother me
KEY-355026: [%person#2-first] is living in a dream world if he thinks he is capable of masterminding a victory over us. We'll outplay them on [%date#1-day] like we outplay most sides and he'll be forced to eat his words
KEY-355027: [%person#2-first] is one of football's good guys, it's always a pleasure coming up against him but I'm happy to have got the result we were after today
KEY-355028: [%person#2-first] is one of football's good guys, it's always a pleasure coming up against him but I'm not happy with the way things went out there. We need to work out what went wrong and get back to winning ways
KEY-355029: [%person#2-first] is very fortunate to have such a wealth of experience available to him and it does give us something to think about. We have to hope that we might have the upper-hand over one or two of their players in terms of fitness which could give us the edge
KEY-355030: [%person#2-first] might have had a point and I always like to take constructive criticism on board and who knows, he might be in for a surprise from us on [%date#1-day]
KEY-355031: [%person#2-first] played right into my hands. It's clear to everyone that he thinks he can drag [%team#2] out of this mess by just turning up and I'm delighted that we've added to their woes today
KEY-355032: [%person#2-first] plays a good, entertaining brand of football by getting the ball forward quickly. His side can be very dangerous in that sense and we will have to be at our best to stop them
KEY-355033: [%person#2-first] was just doing what any good manager does by looking for a way to give his side the edge going into the match. I'm pleased it didn't work but I don't think any less of him as a result
KEY-355034: [%person#2-first] was just trying to give his side an advantage as any other manager would do. I don't think anything backfired necessarily, he just came up against a very good performance from my lads
KEY-355035: [%person#2-first] will be delighted with his achievement and rightly so, he's done brilliant work for [%team#2]. I just hope we catch him on a rare bad day on [%date#1-day]
KEY-355036: [%person#2-first] side have been unlucky lately, the stats can sometimes be a bit misleading and we certainly won't be expecting to get anything on [%date#1-day] without working very hard ourselves
KEY-355037: [%person#2-surname] has just made [%person#2-himself] look ridiculous. He's showing disrespect to not only us, but some opponents who we've had to be at our very best to beat recently and we're more than ready to make him regret how unprofessional he's been here
KEY-355038: [%person#2-surname] was bang out of order, I don't know who he thinks he is by ridiculing us like that. I can't wait to beat him on [%date#1-day]
KEY-355039: [%person#2] can say what he wants as it won't affect us. We've got great confidence and belief in ourselves at the moment and we know we can get a good result on [%date#1-day] to make him eat his words
KEY-355040: [%person#2] dodged the question when asked about your future as [%team#1-short] manager. How do you feel about his failure to show solidarity to a fellow professional ahead of [%date#1-day] match?
KEY-355041: [%person#2] feels that the result today vindicates his pre-match assertions that your side has too many foreign players, is this something you will look to address given how things went out there?

KEY-359015: It's a nice moment but it means nothing if we're not going to make it count. We have to remain focused as a team and not become complacent
KEY-359016: It's a part of the modern game at this level and to be honest, everyone's well aware of those demands by now. We have to ensure our focus remains on the future, not the past

KEY-359043: Some believe that cup replays are outdated and only serve to add more matches to already busy schedules. How do you feel about cup replays, should they be scrapped?

KEY-359061: Until it's mathematically impossible, we're going to try to win every match and finish as high in the league as we can. I don't know any other way of working
KEY-359062: We always practice penalties if there's a chance they're going to be required to decide a match, so we've done that ahead of this tie
KEY-359063: We can't win every game, but there were a number of things I thought we did well out there and we can build from those positives
KEY-359064: We dominated the first match but couldn't finish them off; so that's what we need to do now
KEY-359065: We may not have our name engraved on the trophy but I still feel we're the best side in this competition. We'll prove that next year
KEY-359066: We weren't at our best last time and being honest we were fortunate to get this replay. We've got to take advantage of that fortune now

KEY-359077: Would you agree that [%team#2-short] might be slight favourites for the replay with home advantage on their side?
KEY-359079: Yes, definitely. [%team#2-short] won't enjoy coming to our place and they might regret not finishing the job here

KEY-359088: I am pleased, yes. We weren't given much of a chance here today but we've shown a little bit of what we're capable of
KEY-359089: I can understand that point of view, and I suppose ideally I would have liked to have avoided yet another fixture
KEY-359092: I certainly hope we can go on and push for greater success, but it's not going to be entirely in our hands, so we'll just have to do as much as we can and then hope
KEY-359094: I don't think we need to do anything differently. I'm hoping for a repeat performance and if we can produce that, we should progress
KEY-359095: I feel he can give us some short-term stability whilst we await the return of our regular goalkeepers, and that's all I'm asking for really
KEY-359096: I feel he can give us some short-term stability whilst we await the return of our regulars, and that's all I'm asking for really
KEY-359098: I have faith that the players will see it through and get the result we need
KEY-359099: I might surprise you all by saying this but I think being in the [%comp#2-short] would be a bad thing for this club at this point in time
KEY-359100: I think he can certainly come in and do the job being asked of him and, who knows, he could give me a few tricky decisions if he plays well!
KEY-359101: I think that's really unfair, they gave everything they had today and it just wasn't meant to be
KEY-359102: I think they'll surprise a lot of people and survive relatively comfortably
KEY-359103: I think we'd be kidding ourselves if we thought there was any realistic chance of that. Our focus will be on getting into the [%comp#1-short]
KEY-359104: I think we'd be kidding ourselves if we thought there was any realistic chance of that. Our focus will be on getting into the playoffs and then winning them
KEY-359105: I thought we had the players to win it but I was wrong. Expect us to be active in the transfer market in the coming months
KEY-359106: I wouldn't go along with scrapping them. Replays are a long-held tradition of this competition and I think traditions should mean something
KEY-359107: I wouldn't necessarily agree with that. Often in these situations you find that players think they have something to prove to any potential new manager
KEY-359111: I'd be foolish if my focus was on anything other than the next match. You can ask me if I'm relieved if we get the point but until then, I have work to do
KEY-359112: I'd be foolish if my focus was on anything other than the next match. You can ask me if I'm relieved if we win but until then, I have work to do
KEY-359113: I'd be lying if I said I wasn't hoping for the best possible reward but for now we just have to focus on what we can control ourselves
KEY-359114: I'd like to think so. Getting a draw here is a decent result and hopefully we'll find it easier playing in front of our own fans
KEY-359115: I'd like to think we can, yes. They're a team in turmoil at the moment and it should give us a boost
KEY-359119: I'm actually a little disappointed because we had the chances to win it here today, and we might not be so lucky in the replay
KEY-359121: I'm as ambitious as they come and if there's any scenario in which we could benefit and play at a higher standard of football, then I hope it comes to pass
KEY-359122: I'm delighted for the lads, they've worked incredibly hard to turn things around and never let their heads drop. Now we've broken the bad run, there's no reason to think we can't make good on it and put together a few wins
KEY-359123: I'm delighted. He's the best person for the job and I'm looking forward to continuing our working relationship
KEY-359124: I'm disappointed because it's a match we should have won, but now instead we have to jam another fixture into an already packed schedule
KEY-359125: I'm excited about getting back into the swing of things. The international break has allowed my coaching staff and I to work on some finer tactical details and we're keen to see them in action
KEY-359126: I'm hardly overjoyed at the news. It's well known that we don't enjoy the best of relationships
KEY-359128: I'm not counting any chickens just yet; football can be a funny old game and it can let you down at a moment's notice. We just have to approach the match as we always do
KEY-359129: I'm not counting any chickens just yet; football can be a funny old game and it can let you down at a moment's notice. We just have to approach the match as we always do
KEY-359131: I'm not going to put my neck on the line and say something I may later regret. We'll just see what happens
KEY-359132: I'm pleased for him. He works incredibly hard for this club and I know just how much he wanted to win this vote
KEY-359134: I'm sick of breaks in the schedule and I'm sick of international football getting in the way of more important things. I would rather not have to bother with it whatsoever
KEY-359135: I'm still disappointed that we weren't able to come up with a decisive result the first time around
KEY-359136: I'm struggling to work out quite how they'd do it, unfortunately. They just don't look strong enough
KEY-359138: I'm very confident. The lads have been superb all season and deserve their success, whenever it arrives. There's going to be a very big celebration!
KEY-359139: I'm very confident. The lads have been superb all season and deserve to be in the mix. Once we're there, anything can happen but I know how much these boys want it
KEY-359141: I'm very confident. The lads have been superb all season and deserve to go up
KEY-359142: I'm very confident. We deserve to qualify and it's just a matter of when and not if at this stage
KEY-359143: I'm very disappointed with the result. It was a fixture we were very capable of winning and it would have been nice to at least try to go further in the competition.
KEY-359144: I've got complete faith in [%male#2-first] abilities and wouldn't have brought him into the club if I didn't. He'll help us out in a time of need
KEY-359145: I've got complete faith in [%male#2-first] abilities and wouldn't have brought him into the club if I didn't. The team is in good hands
KEY-359146: I've looked back at the first tie and there are areas of our game we can improve on slightly. I also think we know more about the opposition now, so that could be vital
KEY-359147: I've never placed much significance on home advantage to be honest. Anything can happen in the cup
KEY-359148: I've never seen the boys so up for a match. They know what's at stake and after the week of training they've had, I'm confident we'll be fine
KEY-359150: My main concern is to ensure that the lads treat the match like any other. If or when we become champions, then they can let their hair down
KEY-359151: My main concern is to ensure that the lads treat the match like any other. If or when we go up, then they can let their hair down
KEY-359152: My main concern is to ensure that the lads treat the match like any other. If or when we qualify, then they can celebrate
KEY-359153: My main concern is to ensure that the lads treat the match like any other. If or when we qualify, we can then look forward to those experiences
KEY-359154: My main concern is to ensure that the lads treat the match like any other
KEY-359160: You return to club action this weekend after an international period in which a number of [%team#1-short] players were away representing their countries. How do you see that affecting the team ahead of the upcoming fixture?
KEY-359162: Your decision to go out and bring in [%male#2] was clearly influenced by [%team#1-short] goalkeeping injury crisis. Are you confident that he can hold the fort until the likes of [%male#3] are fit to return?
KEY-359163: Your players looked dejected at the final whistle, knowing the title had gone to [%team#2-short]. Surely the dressing room wasn't a pleasant place to be after that?
KEY-359270: [%person#2] will continue to call the shots at [%team#1-short] after being re-elected for another term. What is your reaction to the election results?
KEY-359284: [%team#1-short] were favourites to clinch the title today but it's gone elsewhere. Do you feel some of your players believed the title was already won?
KEY-359285: [%team#1] will be looking to win the [%comp#1-short] for the first time in the club's [%number#4] year history when they play [%team#2] on [%date#1-day], having previously appeared in [%number#1] finals without success.
KEY-359286: [%team#1] will be looking to win the [%comp#1-short] for the first time in the club's history when they play [%team#2] on [%date#1-day], having previously appeared in [%number#1] finals without success.
KEY-359293: {upper}[%person#1-surname] has indicated that, unless you decide to treat him at the club, [%male#2] will be sent home to minimise the risk of his illness spreading to other members of the squad.
KEY-359294: {upper}[%player_description#1] [%male#1] added to an already bad day at the office for [%team#1-short] on [%number#3] minutes when he managed to score [%basic_goal_description#1].
KEY-359295: {upper}[%player_description#1] [%male#1] compounded the misery for [%team#1-short] on [%number#3] minutes with [%basic_goal_description#1].
KEY-359296: {upper}[%player_description#1] [%male#1] denied [%team#1-short] the win however as he scored [%basic_goal_description#1] with just [%number#1] minutes to go.
KEY-359297: {upper}[%player_description#1] [%male#1] ensured things went from bad to worse for [%team#1-short] on [%number#3] minutes with [%basic_goal_description#1].
KEY-359298: {upper}[%player_description#1] [%male#1] had a moment he will quickly want to forget about in the [%number#3-nth] minute when he contrived to score [%basic_goal_description#1].
KEY-359299: {upper}[%player_description#1] [%male#1] had a moment he will quickly want to forget about in the opening minute when he contrived to score [%basic_goal_description#1].
KEY-359300: {upper}[%player_description#1] [%male#1] suffered the agony of [%basic_goal_description#1] after [%number#3] minutes to deny his team the win.
KEY-359301: {upper}[%player_description#1] [%male#1] suffered the ignominy of scoring [%basic_goal_description#1] in the [%number#3-nth] minute.
KEY-359302: {upper}[%player_description#1] [%male#1] suffered the ignominy of scoring [%basic_goal_description#1] in the opening minute of the match.
KEY-359303: {upper}[%player_description#1] [%male#1] was left red-faced in the [%number#3-nth] minute as he managed to score [%basic_goal_description#1].
KEY-359304: {upper}[%player_description#1] [%male#1] was left red-faced in the [%number#3-nth] minute following [%basic_goal_description#1].
KEY-359305: {upper}[%player_description#1] [%male#1] was left red-faced in the very first minute as he managed to score [%basic_goal_description#1].
KEY-359306: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] recent sequence of good results has seen the club stride into the top half of the table and many fans are happy with the start the club have made so far this season.
KEY-359375: A match of this magnitude shouldn't be played on the opening day of the season. It's poorly timed for so many reasons
KEY-359388: Are you confident that your team has the ability to pick themselves up from title disappointment and come back stronger next season?
KEY-359398: Are you looking to make [%male#2] a permanent member of the squad? The fans will surely want him to stay after performances like that.
KEY-359418: Can you turn things around here and lead [%team#1-short] towards the expectations they harboured at the start of the season?
KEY-359433: Certain players proved to me that they don't have a real winner's mentality. Some of them just aren't good enough for what we're trying to achieve
KEY-359459: Do you think it's important for the club to continue their impressive record of winning on many of the more recent opening days of the season?
KEY-359460: Do you think that still being in competitions like the [%comp#1-short] will be beneficial to helping you succeed this season?
KEY-359461: Do you think the next three fixtures represent a good chance of getting off to a good start here?
KEY-359462: Do you think the team's recent form can be put down to mentality? The players are clearly good enough, so perhaps it's just a matter of ensuring they're focused and prepared from a psychological point of view?
KEY-359469: Every team in this league has earned their place, but at the same time we've got the opportunity to start against a team who will still be finding their feet at this level and I'm hoping we can take advantage of that
KEY-359470: Fans of [%team#1] were justly proud after the team lifted the [%comp#1] trophy. [BRK_LN] Fans and pundits alike were unanimous that the person responsible for the team's success was [%person#1].
KEY-359574: It gives us a great opportunity to take our focus away from the league and change our approach slightly. It would be great for the club if we could go deep into the competition
KEY-359575: It might be nice to experiment a little bit here and there but my main focus is on the league
KEY-359576: It sparked something of a reaction from the opposition and meant we had to work even harder for our win
KEY-359585: It would be hugely disrespectful to [%team#2-short] to suggest this is going to be an easy match. They're here on merit and are every bit as capable of beating us as anyone else is
KEY-359586: It would be nice to get off to a winning start and I think we're capable of getting a result or two
KEY-359589: It'll go right down to the wire but I don't see a reason why they can't stay up
KEY-359592: It's a bit disappointing to hear that he wasn't being entirely genuine before the match but I guess that's something we'll all have to learn from following that result
KEY-359594: It's a great moment and I can't wait to get started. The lads are well prepared and confident of a winning start
KEY-359598: It's a tough time, no questions about it. I feel a degree of pressure but I wouldn't have it any other way. Hopefully it brings out the best in all of us
KEY-359599: It's all fun and games when you win big derby matches but a defeat can have terrible ramifications. That's no way to start a season
KEY-359603: It's an absolute miracle, he doesn't even score in training! I'm delighted for him on a personal level as well, he deserves moments like that
KEY-359604: It's an exciting way to get things off and running. The fans will doubtless be up for it and the players will feed off their passion
KEY-359605: It's an inevitable consequence of our business that poor form will result in increased pressure and job speculation. I feel that, I understand that and will continue to work hard to turn things around
KEY-359606: It's an opportunity to make an immediate statement about what sort of team we'll be this season. If we can go away from home and win it'll go down very nicely
KEY-359611: It's certainly a tough way to kick things off but it gives us a chance to pull off something of a shock and make people sit up and take notice
KEY-359612: It's certainly one of the harder fixtures we could have had, yes. These are the games we all live for though and I'm determined to enjoy it
KEY-359614: It's easy to switch off and simply assume we're going to win. I have to make sure the players are completely focused
KEY-359615: It's fair to say that [%team#1-short] and the opening day of the season haven't gone well together in recent years. Is this the season things change for the better?
KEY-359617: It's hardly a fixture to get the supporters excited about the new season really. They'd rather have had a different match to look forward to, I'm sure
KEY-359618: It's hardly an ideal way to start the season. It's a big match charged with emotions and it could be catastrophic for anyone on the losing side
KEY-359619: It's important that we treat this match as we would any other. If we become distracted by silly notions of 'revenge' it could come back to haunt us
KEY-359620: It's important to remain focused on the next match and nothing more. We will take things one match at a time and do our best to win as often as possible
KEY-359621: It's impossible to feel any positive emotions during a relegation struggle and I know that any result is going to be hard-earned. It's not going to be easy at all
KEY-359622: It's inevitable that some heads will drop with each result that goes against us. It can become a vicious cycle so it's my job to try to keep everybody on an even keel
KEY-359623: It's never nice to be without an important player and we won't be the same without him, but we'll do our best
KEY-359624: It's not a trend the club is proud of, but unfortunately it might continue and we'll have to deal with that as best we can
KEY-359625: It's not an easy match but it's easier than we could've had, definitely. It gives us an opportunity to get on the board at the very least
KEY-359626: It's not been ideal for us; the lads like to play regularly so as to be able to get into a rhythm and they've not been able to do that recently
KEY-359627: It's not surprising to see certain other teams receive nice easy starts at home whilst we're away again, but we'll get on with it and continue to prove people wrong
KEY-359631: Look at the reaction of my players after winning this. It speaks volumes; they're winners and they want to experience this feeling again and again
KEY-359632: Looking at your first three games in charge, are you confident of getting off to a good start?
KEY-359633: Looking at some of the teams left in the competition, maybe not very far at all! We're just happy to be here and we'll take it one game at a time
KEY-359634: Might you have a problem motivating the team against opposition like [%team#2-short]? Complacency must surely be an issue ahead of this match?
KEY-359659: Some pundits will argue that whilst [%team#2-short] are top of the league, your [%team#1-short] side are a stronger team and should win today. Do you think we'll see that on the pitch on [%date#1-day]?
KEY-359660: Some pundits will argue that whilst [%team#2-short] are top of the league, your [%team#1-short] side are a stronger team and should win today. Do you think we'll see that on the pitch?
KEY-359681: These are the fixtures you want when you dream of promotion. The fans will have been looking out for this one and can mark it off nice and early
KEY-359683: These things happen in football. [%male#2-first] knows he made a mistake but he's not the first and won't be the last to do so. I trust him completely
KEY-359684: They always have a chance because their best players are capable of winning any match. It'll be tough for us, there's no doubt about that
KEY-359685: They might have recently hauled themselves out of the relegation zone but this clash at [%stadium#1] is arguably the biggest of the season for both teams. Are you confident of winning?
KEY-359694: This is the right opportunity for me personally and it comes at the perfect time in my career. I believe I can develop considerably at [%team#1-short]
KEY-359696: This one was a particularly bitter pill to swallow and the lads are reeling from it a bit. It's my job to pick them up from it
KEY-359700: Unfortunately this is one of those occasions where we're going to have to take a risk and play [%male#2-first]
KEY-359702: Unfortunately, we're in a cut-throat business and I have sympathy for [%person#2-first]. The board felt a change was required and that's the way they chose to act
KEY-359706: We all want to be playing on this stage. It's a big opportunity for our boys to impress and to show what they're capable of
KEY-359707: We all want to get off to a good start and this gives us a fighting chance. We're all very excited and keen to get underway
KEY-359708: We always try to attack where possible. We will play with intensity and with control and look to dominate the match
KEY-359711: We challenge each other and don't always agree, but that's part of managing a club like this and it's never become unbearable
KEY-359715: We didn't begin to play as well as we're capable of. It was disappointing in every department and it was not good enough
KEY-359718: We have a target on our backs; everyone will want to be the team to end our run. We've got some tough matches coming up and maybe we'll lose one of those
KEY-359721: We have the quality and depth of squad to put up a good showing in every competition. We want to win, we want to breed a successful culture here and every victory helps us achieve that
KEY-359724: We really have to make sure we play to our potential in these matches because there are many bigger tests to come this season
KEY-359725: We want to get off to a good start and we want to build some momentum early on in the season. We can't do that if we don't win at the first opportunity
KEY-359728: We want winning to be ingrained in the culture of this club, so if it's there to be won, we'll compete for it
KEY-359730: We will rotate the normal amount and that will likely include a rest for one or two players, yes
KEY-359733: We'd done ever so well to get into the position to win it; despite today's result the players can look back and be proud of their performances this season
KEY-359741: We're going to give it our best shot. I know my players are capable of it; they now have to prove it
KEY-359745: We've been given an opportunity to assert ourselves as the better team and I couldn't be happier with that
KEY-359746: We've got some tough fixtures coming up and if we don't work even harder than we have been another poor sequence of results could be on the cards. We have to make sure that doesn't happen
KEY-359747: We've had a big let-off today. The opposition must be wondering how they've managed to lose that. We were terrible but have somehow come out of it with a win
KEY-359748: We've not been given the easiest of starts by any stretch of the imagination but we'll do our best and see what happens
KEY-359767: Will you be targeting competitions like the [%comp#1-short] early in your tenure?
KEY-359782: With all due respect to them, there were much tougher fixtures we could've had. It won't be an easy game but it's certainly preferential
KEY-359791: Yes, I'm trying to bring him back here. It would be a loan deal because it's something that benefits all parties at this stage
KEY-359792: You won't find me complaining about any opportunity for the players to rest and for extra tactical work to be done on the training pitch!
KEY-359799: [%male#2] was brilliant today wasn't he? It can't be very often you come up against an opponent who puts in that type of performance?
KEY-359806: I agree with that completely. We really should be able to settle the first tie with extra time and penalties
KEY-359809: I believe in their philosophies and feel that this is the ideal place to take my career to the next level
KEY-359812: I believe the team is developing well; they are working towards the right mentality and philosophy, and every match we play will help to develop that
KEY-359813: I came here under no illusions about the scale of the task required. A lengthy rebuilding process is required but I'm certainly up for the challenge
KEY-359816: I can't wait to get started. I have plenty of ideas for this team and we're going to surprise a few people with how quickly this situation can change
KEY-359823: I don't know for sure yet how we'll approach these matches and I can't offer a prediction
KEY-359825: I don't think [%team#2-short] expected us to put in a performance like that. We've certainly given them food for thought
KEY-359829: I don't think it makes as much of a difference as you might think, at least in terms of the first match. We all face the same fixture list; the order in which we go about it doesn't matter very much
KEY-359830: I don't think it was that important to be honest. There was a lot of football to be played after it was scored and we won by producing the goods from the first minute until the last
KEY-359833: I don't think so. I know my players; they're dedicated, focused and want to be consistently successful
KEY-359834: I don't think there's a lot in it really. This is a close-knit group of players with great camaraderie and we've been through good spells and bad
KEY-359835: I don't think there's a lot of work to be done here. If we pay closer attention to the small details, everything will be fine before too long
KEY-359837: I don't want my players to get drawn into the idea that the first game is somehow more important than the rest. We have a whole season to focus on
KEY-359838: I don't want anybody to have a false impression that this will be a smooth transition. A number of things have gone wrong at this club and it will take time to fix properly
KEY-359839: I don't want to beat them because they beat us; I want to win because I want to win every match we play
KEY-359840: I don't want to look too far ahead but it's a friendlier draw than some have been afforded, definitely
KEY-359846: I feel as if too many people place too much attention on the opening match of the season. Let's just get it over and done with so we can move on
KEY-359853: I have a team for this match. The squad is there to be used for a range of circumstances and I will be using it extensively this season
KEY-359854: I have faith in my squad. This is an opportunity for someone to step up and make an impression
KEY-359856: I have no concerns about our mental strength. Everyone in that dressing room is strong enough to understand the peaks and troughs of a football season and they know what it takes to win
KEY-359859: I have to focus on making sure we're up to standard in the league first and foremost
KEY-359860: I have to hold my hands up and admit that he was just too good today. He's a top class player and it really showed
KEY-359862: I have to take the blame for the bad start but once we'd adjusted and made a few changes the boys were magnificent and deserved to win
KEY-359866: I hope we can win. It might only seem like a small thing but for me there's a major difference in how the players and fans react to starting the season with a win compared to a defeat
KEY-359871: I need to sit down and evaluate the squad properly before I'm comfortable answering questions about what we can achieve
KEY-359873: I raised a smile when I saw who we'd been given; we'll know what to expect from them and can hopefully look forward to a victory
KEY-359874: I say bring it on! We were going to have to play them at some point but at least we might be able to catch them off guard before they've had a chance to get into their groove
KEY-359875: I share their philosophical view on football. We had a very engaging discussion before I agreed to join and left very excited about what we could achieve together
KEY-359876: I think [%person#2-surname] had his ideas about how to succeed but the time was right for a change and I believe I can make swift improvements
KEY-359879: I think it definitely gives us an opportunity to build up some momentum and work towards a very tangible early reward
KEY-359882: I think it's an absolute joke that some teams consistently receive favourable fixture lists whilst we're let down once again. It cannot continue to happen
KEY-359883: I think it's fairly clear that we're not the best of friends. We get on with our jobs and deal with each other as professionally as we can whenever we have to
KEY-359885: I think suggestions of a 'giant-killing' might be optimistic. We're going to go there, enjoy the day and give a good account of ourselves. Anything else would be a dream come true
KEY-359888: I think the players need to be in the right place mentally, for sure. We all know what it'll take to pick up our form and I'm confident we can make that happen
KEY-359890: I think their ambition is fantastic. They want to be successful and they will not compromise on being the best
KEY-359891: I think there are a number of positives to starting away from home, not least the idea that an impressive win will send a message to everyone in this league
KEY-359897: I think they've got the right players and the right manager to battle successfully
KEY-359905: I think we'll be fine. Obviously [%male#2-first] is a terrific player but my squad is strong and very, very capable
KEY-359909: I thought we could've gone a lot further and I'm not happy at all with how things went today
KEY-359914: I want to be fair to the supporters in telling them that things will get worse before they get better, but they will get better
KEY-359915: I want to have a positive start here and there's definitely an opportunity to make that happen
KEY-359918: I want to work at the very top of this sport and this job helps me work towards achieving that
KEY-359921: I wasn't happy with our approach to one or two of the friendlies and we need to make major improvements in the coming weeks
KEY-359925: I won't disrespect [%person#2-first] by discussing his time here. It's not my place to talk about things I had no involvement in
KEY-359926: I would always rather play at home than away. At home is where we intend to pick up the majority of our points and there's no better time to start than with the first match of the season
KEY-359927: I would expect us to win even if we were away from home so it doesn't make much of a difference to me
KEY-359928: I would have preferred a little more time with a fully fit and available squad but we have to make do with the hand we've been dealt
KEY-359929: I would have preferred an easier start! It's as tough a match as we could've had but at least it'll be out of the way
KEY-359934: I would say there's some truth to that. A few heads need to be lifted and some players need to be told in no uncertain terms what's expected of them
KEY-359935: I wouldn't consider this an easy fixture, regardless of whether we're at home. We'll have easier matches away at other grounds this season
KEY-359938: I wouldn't say he did anything wrong, and I respect him as a manager, but sometimes a fresh start is required and that seems to be the case here
KEY-359939: I wouldn't say it's solely responsible, that would be too simple a conclusion to draw. We're not playing well and we're picking up poor habits. Things need to change
KEY-359941: I'd be delighted to even be in the discussion for the [%comp#2-short] to be honest. For now though, it's best if we just make sure we qualify for the [%comp#1-short]
KEY-359942: I'd be delighted to even be in the discussion for the [%comp#2-short] to be honest. For now though, it's best if we just make sure we qualify for the [%comp#5-short]
KEY-359943: I'd be delighted to even be in the discussion to be honest. We're yet to secure even a playoff berth but realistically it's hard to look much beyond that at this stage
KEY-359945: I'd have preferred a different fixture, if only because it's something different and more interesting
KEY-359946: I'd have preferred to avoid a big match. The league should be factoring these things into their plans and saving major occasions for other dates
KEY-359947: I'd have preferred to avoid the promoted teams. They're still riding the euphoria of promotion and will start like a house on fire. We've got a real game on our hands here
KEY-359948: I'd love to keep him here permanently and when the opportunity arises it'll be amongst my highest priorities
KEY-359951: I'll always give us a chance against anyone, even the best of the best. It won't be easy but it's a great way to get things started
KEY-359953: I'll be glad when it's out of the way and we can focus on the next few matches. There's an unbelievable amount of hype that comes with the 'big kick-off'
KEY-359955: I'll never ignore results as that's what this business demands, but right now I'm focusing on changing the way this team plays. The results might not come immediately, but they will come
KEY-359956: I'll never rule anything out. Everybody here wants the squad to be as strong as possible and if a player we like becomes available, who knows?
KEY-359958: I'll rotate the usual amount, but yes, I think it's a good idea to make sure our important players are in perfect condition for our most important matches
KEY-359962: I'm concerned that a defeat could send us spiralling into a poor run of form. We have to make sure that doesn't happen
KEY-359968: I'm delighted to be at home. There's a real buzz around the stadium when a new season begins and the players will definitely feed off that
KEY-359969: I'm delighted. We weren't at the races for a while but the players showed fantastic spirit to change the course of the match
KEY-359972: I'm happy to give the lads the opportunity to prove themselves in a wide range of competitions
KEY-359973: I'm happy to go up against them this early in the season. It gets it out of the way at least
KEY-359974: I'm happy to have been given the chance to work here and to further my professional experiences
KEY-359975: I'm happy to start away from home. We have confidence in our ability and we're arguably a stronger team mentally when we play elsewhere
KEY-359977: I'm not going to talk about other teams. I have enough on my plate as it is
KEY-359979: I'm not sure we're in a position to be looking for immediate rewards. The long-term improvements we're hoping for are what I'm really concerned with
KEY-359980: I'm not surprised that we've been handed another curious fixture assignment. Nothing changes...
KEY-359982: I'm pleased with the fixture we've been given. It adds a little background to the occasion and we can draw on last season's experiences to make us stronger
KEY-359983: I'm pleased with the work we've put in on the training pitch and hopefully it shows when we get back to business
KEY-359986: I'm really not surprised that he would resort to underhand tactics like that. He could have adopted a different approach and still come out of the match with a result
KEY-359991: I'm very confident in my ability as a manager and this club will be back on the right track before very long
KEY-359993: I'm very confident. The lads have been superb all season and deserve to be playing in top quality competitions
KEY-359994: I'm very interested to see how this team gets on against a very big team. It will be very revealing for me to see their mentality in particular
KEY-359996: I've already identified a number of areas in need of improvement and I don't intend on repeating [%person#2-surname] mistakes
KEY-359998: I've discussed it with my coaching staff and we'll make a decision closer to kick-off, but we're leaning that way for sure
KEY-360000: I've made it clear to the entire squad that there will be a regular core of players to be relied on, but everyone is keen to impress to try to work their way into that group
KEY-360002: I've seen him play better; some people are just inclined to claim certain players had a good match regardless of their actual performance
KEY-360003: My fear is that a defeat might result in my players doubting whether they belong at this level
KEY-360005: My job is to win football matches. Our approach will be one which gives us the best chance of doing that
KEY-360006: My main concern is to ensure that the lads treat the match like any other. If or when we go up, then they can let their hair down
KEY-360010: You must be expecting a win at [%stadium#1] on [%date#1-day], even after taking into account [%team#2-nickname] recent upturn in fortunes?
KEY-360011: You must be expecting a win at [%stadium#1] today, even after taking into account [%team#2-nickname] recent upturn in fortunes?
KEY-360016: You've got to be pleased with a draw against [%team#2-short] considering most people expected a comfortable victory for them?
KEY-360019: Your [%team#1-short] side are expected to win, but taking into account [%team#2-short] recent good form, are you confident?
KEY-360021: Your team stands up well to [%team#2-short] in terms of results so far this season but can you prove your quality against them on the pitch at [%stadium#1]?
KEY-360088: [%person#2-first] is a great manager and a better person. I consider him a friend
KEY-360089: [%person#2] of [%team#4-short] was the runner-up for the award after impressing on loan at [%team#2-short], whilst another loanee, [%team#5-short] [%person#3], completed the top three after consistently producing the goods at [%team#3-short].
KEY-360097: [%team#1-short] don't have the best record on opening days in recent years. Can you explain this trend and are you confident of turning things around this season?
KEY-360099: [%team#1-short] have an impressive record of starting the season with a win in recent years. Is this something you're keen to see continue?
KEY-360102: [%team#1-short] have been handed a tough opening day assignment against defending champions [%team#2-short]. Could you have wished for a harder start?
KEY-360104: [%team#1-short] have been handed an opening day fixture against newly-promoted [%team#2-short]. Do you consider that amongst the easier starts available?
KEY-360105: [%team#1-short] have been handed something of a baptism of fire following promotion, opening the season away to [%team#2-short]. What was your reaction when you saw that atop the fixture list?
KEY-360106: [%team#1-short] have been handed yet another away fixture to kick off the season. How much does that sort of stuff matter?
KEY-360107: [%team#1-short] have been handed yet another home fixture to kick off the season. How much does that sort of stuff matter?
KEY-360108: [%team#1] manager [%person#1] has not found room for [%male#2] in his squad for the forthcoming [%comp#1].
KEY-360109: [%team#1] manager [%person#1] has not found room for [%male#2] in his squad to face [%team_list#1].
KEY-360110: [%team#2-nickname] might well have escaped the relegation zone for now but most people are expecting a comfortable [%team#1-short] win here. Is that an assessment you agree with?
KEY-360111: [%team#2-nickname] might well have hauled themselves out of the drop zone but it'll take a brave pundit to predict a victory for them against your [%team#1-short] team at [%stadium#1] on [%date#1-day]. How do you see the game going?
KEY-360112: [%team#2-nickname] might well have hauled themselves out of the drop zone but it'll take a brave pundit to predict a victory for them against your [%team#1-short] team at [%stadium#1] today. How do you see the game going?
KEY-360113: [%team#2-short] are a dangerous team with a number of good players. This isn't an easy match
KEY-360114: [%team#2-short] are a team [%team#1-short] shouldn't have too many problems against, but are you or your players worried about a potential giant-killing?
KEY-360115: [%team#2-short] are currently without a manager after parting company with previous boss [%person#2]. Is this something you can use to your advantage?
KEY-360119: [%team#2-short] are very capable of beating us, especially if we turn up and try to just go through the motions. It's imperative we approach this professionally
KEY-360122: [%team#2-short] have done magnificently to be top of the table but your [%team#1-short] side are still a force to be reckoned with. Do you agree with the suggestion that you are favourites on [%date#1-day]?
KEY-360123: [%team#2-short] have done magnificently to be top of the table but your [%team#1-short] side are still a force to be reckoned with. Do you agree with the suggestion that you are favourites today?
KEY-360127: [%team#2] face [%team#3] and will be hoping for a win to alleviate their relegation fears. Can you see them staying up?
KEY-360443: [%person#1-surname] favours higher seeds' chances
KEY-360511: [%team#1-short] have been handed a relatively kind opening fixture following promotion; a home outing against [%team#2-short]. What was your reaction when you saw that atop the fixture list?
KEY-360513: [%team#2-short] are a good side - they wouldn't have got to this point were they not - but I believe my boys are a force to be reckoned with
KEY-360514: [%team#2-short] got the better of your team during the regular season; can you make it count when it matters most though?
KEY-360515: [%team#2-short] will come into this match with all the confidence of a newly-promoted club and will still have that swagger about them. It's not an easy game in the slightest

KEY-363575: All we can do is go out and do our part and hope that everything else falls in our favour. I remain optimistic

KEY-364285: Defending is almost a dirty word these days but if we make sure we do the simple things right then we'll be in with a great chance of getting a result
KEY-364288: Despite being extremely keen to retain your services, there is no way that we can accommodate your requests due to disagreements in the following areas:
KEY-364581: Keep Teams From Same Group Together

KEY-364778: Take over his contract if buying him due to MLS internal transfer rules.
KEY-364788: Teams get incremental seeding values starting from the seeding value
KEY-364794: The [%team#2-short] [%position#1-lowercase], who was originally dropped by former manager [%person#3], clearly has more work to do if he is to force his way back into the [%team#1-short] setup.
KEY-364811: This can be used to create a custom fixture plan between groups so that, for example, teams from the same group can play one another a different number of times
KEY-364814: Throw It Long
KEY-364859: We are still willing to talk to you about a new contract, but we must stress that it would be under the existing club vision.
KEY-364860: We can't afford to get drawn into a high-tempo attacking match. We have to defend properly
KEY-364861: We expect you to continue working towards the existing philosophies and will be appraising you accordingly.
KEY-364862: We expect you to continue working towards the existing philosophies and will be judging you accordingly.
KEY-364863: We expect you to work towards the philosophies set out during the initial meeting and will be appraising you accordingly.
KEY-364864: We expect you to work towards the philosophies set out during the initial meeting and will be judging you accordingly.
KEY-364865: We need to be proactive and seek an early advantage. If we play the game on our terms we'll win
KEY-364866: We want to attack, to play with freedom and with style, but at the same time we have to make sure we don't leave ourselves wide open defensively
KEY-364867: We want to win every game regardless of it being a clash against a bitter rival or a routine home game against somebody else
KEY-364870: We won't be doing our chances of victory any good if we get involved in that sort of thing. It simply cannot happen
KEY-364871: We would however be willing to enter into talks over a new contract if you are willing to stick with the current club vision.
KEY-364872: We would very much like to keep you at the club, but we cannot agree to your proposed vision due to disagreements in the following areas:
KEY-364873: We're in similar positions and with such fine margins likely to decide the result I have to make sure I take advantage of everything I possibly can
KEY-364874: We've looked good in training and were prepared for this eventuality so I think we'll be fine
KEY-364877: When asked to report on a competition, your scouts will travel to watch the competition closely and report on any players they think might be of interest to you.
KEY-364878: When asked to report on a nation, your scouts will travel around that country watching matches and reporting on any players they think might be of interest to you.
KEY-364879: When asked to report on a region, your scouts will travel around that region watching matches and reporting on any players they think might be of interest to you.
KEY-364880: When we have the kind of support from our fans that we're expecting there's no reason to be concerned. The players will feed off that from the first kick
KEY-364882: Whipped Crosses
KEY-364883: Why him in particular? What makes him someone you think [%team#1-short] can take advantage of?
KEY-364886: Will your hectic schedule see you field a weakened team against [%team#2-short]?
KEY-364887: With a big match against [%team#3-short] on the horizon how likely are you to field a weakened team against [%team#2-short]?
KEY-364888: With this approach, each player is expected to focus on a single phase of play within a very structured system. [BRK_LN] Defenders are responsible only for the defensive phase, midfielders are responsible only for the transition phase and forwards are responsible only for the attacking phase. [BRK_LN] The team will be expected to keep its shape at all times, playing very precise and controlled football with players allowed little creative freedom.
KEY-364889: With this match coming so soon after your clash with [%team#3-short] how likely are you to field a weakened team?
KEY-364891: Worsened slightly on his [%attribute_description#1] and his [%attribute_description#2] over the last [%number#1] months.
KEY-364906: [%club#1-short] {lower}[%job#1] [%person#1] has criticised the media for compounding rumours that he is being courted for the managerial role at [%club#2-short]. [BRK_LN] In a brief press call early this morning, [%person#1-surname] underlined his commitment to the players and the fans, declaring that he had every intention of staying at [%stadium#1] while he was still wanted.
KEY-364920: [%male#2] has kept [%number#1] clean sheets in [%number#2] matches against him. Do you have a plan to overcome this particular obstacle and finally make the breakthrough?
KEY-364921: [%male#2] has scored [%number#1] goals in [%number#2] matches against [%team#1-short]. Do you have a plan to stop him?
KEY-364929: I don't have weakened teams; I have different options, all of which feature very good footballers
KEY-364930: I don't know him but I respect him as a manager and hope to get to know him more
KEY-364931: I don't really feel pressure. Football isn't pressure, there are plenty of other things to be worried about in the real world
KEY-364933: I don't think he's been at his best lately and maybe a spell out of the team will help him recapture his best form
KEY-364935: I feel this is a good opportunity for certain players to play and impress
KEY-364936: I felt we needed to bring in a few different players considering our recent schedule and the demands of this particular match
KEY-364938: I found his comments surprising; if I were a [%team#2-short] fan I'd be very concerned because it would appear their manager doesn't believe they can win
KEY-364939: I have a team in mind and it'll require a few changes from last time out
KEY-364941: I suspect he's a little more tense than he's prepared to show but we won't know who's done the better job until full time
KEY-364942: I think it's only natural to feel it a bit but that's what these types of matches are about. I wouldn't want it any other way
KEY-364943: I think so, yes. There's a group of fringe players here who deserve an opportunity to impress whilst some of the younger lads are pressing hard for inclusion as well
KEY-364944: I think the players need to feel the same passion as the supporters and use that to help them win. We all have to come together as one for the club
KEY-364948: I would make us slight favourites and we've prepared well but we have to make sure we start well
KEY-364949: I wouldn't pay too much attention to what he says or how he acts; he's very good at convincing people that he's not in control before beating them on the pitch
KEY-364950: I wouldn't say it's a big change at all; we often switch between various shapes during a match so it's nothing new to my players
KEY-364951: I wouldn't say the competition is of reduced importance to us; we have to respect it by fielding a competitive team and we'd like to do well in it regardless of the bigger picture
KEY-364952: I'd rather talk about the eleven players who will be starting this match; they're the ones I believe give us the best chance of winning what is undoubtedly a tricky fixture
KEY-364953: I'll go about things in my usual way but at the same time I fully understand that it might all go out of the window after a minute of play
KEY-364954: I'm confident in the quality of my squad. Whatever team I select will be formidable and very capable of winning
KEY-364955: I'm confident that the lads can continue as they've been playing and go into this one with the confidence of a familiar line-up
KEY-364956: I'm focusing on what we can do rather than what they're doing; we're confident of doing ourselves justice here today
KEY-364957: I'm looking forward to the game; [%team#2-short] are always a tough opponent and it should be entertaining for the supporters
KEY-364958: I'm privileged to have a squad with fantastic depth and talent and I have complete faith in whichever combination of players is selected on a game-by-game basis
KEY-364959: I'm privileged to have a squad with fantastic depth and talent and they'll give their best today, I'm sure of that
KEY-364960: I'm treating it as I would any other fixture; by doing that I can approach key decisions calmly and objectively
KEY-364961: I'm trying to keep the boys focused on the tactical side of things instead of allowing them to feel the nerves and the tension surrounding a big match like this
KEY-364962: I'm well within my rights to use the full depth of my squad and those selected today deserve to be involved
KEY-364963: I've been around long enough to know that it means almost nothing. His absence won't determine the outcome of this game, the twenty-two players selected will
KEY-364964: I've got nothing against him in particular but it's hard to deny that he's a step behind some of his more capable colleagues
KEY-364965: I've mainly been paying attention to lots of smaller details because that's what'll likely settle the match. The big stuff takes care of itself, especially when playing against a rival
KEY-364966: I've picked a team and a tactical style that I feel gives us the best chance of winning
KEY-364967: I've picked the team I feel gives us the best chance of winning
KEY-364968: I've reminded them not to go too far but you have to play this sort of match with some fire in you; it can be the difference between winning and losing
KEY-364969: I've watched a lot of footage on [%team#2-short] and he's definitely given reason for us to try and exploit his very visible shortcomings
KEY-364970: My team picked itself but it's a very strong team and we've got every chance of winning if we play as well as we're capable of
KEY-364971: You've sprung a few surprises with your team selection today, what's the thinking behind that?
KEY-364972: Your scouting team will report on your next opposition team's strengths and weaknesses as a unit rather than finding specific players of interest.
KEY-364973: Your team selection has offered little by way of surprise today; are you confident ahead of kick-off?
KEY-364974: Your team selection today suggests a change of tactic might be on the cards, what's the thinking behind that?
KEY-364977: [%person#1-surname] claims criticism of style affects [%team#1-short] players
KEY-364981: [%person#1-surname] denies [%team#1-short] are a dirty team

KEY-365525: I have no real concerns; this club has considerable pulling power and we're not affected by outside factors like this
KEY-365526: I think that every approach has its strengths and weaknesses and it's the job of [%person#2-first] and me to try and find that balance between exploiting a weakness and playing to your own strengths
KEY-365527: I'm a little taken aback by it, I have to admit. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect but I learnt a lot about how good my boys can be out there
KEY-365528: I'm disappointed at what's happened if only because it's likely to slow down each stage of the process and delay any potential deal from happening
KEY-365549: You could need just one more result to guarantee survival and avoid relegation this season if things elsewhere go your way. Can you get the job done and how much of a relief will it be if and when you do?
KEY-365560: [%person#1] feels the situation can be resolved by assigning the player to a more suitable individual regime or taking him off the individual training.

KEY-365613: [%team#1-short] are just one win away from booking a spot in the playoffs. Are you confident of getting the result and then going on to make it count?
KEY-365617: [%team#1-short] are on the verge of qualifying for the [%comp#1-short] proper and will do so with a win from your next match. Are you confident of seeing it through and getting the required result?
KEY-365618: [%team#1-short] are potentially just one game away from booking a spot in the playoffs. Are you confident of getting a result and, presuming things elsewhere go in your favour, going on to make it count?

KEY-365620: [%team#1-short] can potentially become champions with one more right result. Are you confident of seeing it through and getting the required result?
KEY-365623: [%team#1-short] can potentially secure at least a playoff place with a win and favourable outcomes elsewhere. Is that enough for you or is there still a greater prize up for grabs in your eyes?

KEY-365640: [%team#1-short] have used their Guaranteed Contract Buyout option on [%male#1]. His Guaranteed Contract will therefore not impact the Salary Cap.
KEY-365642: [%team#1-short] will have the happier set of supporters this evening after gaining a draw against [%team#2-short]. The [%team#2-short] [%job#2] however is likely to be wondering why they weren't able to win the game.
KEY-365643: [%team#1-short] will have the happier set of supporters this evening, especially after they came back from [%number#1] goals down to draw against [%team#2-short]. The [%team#2-short] [%job#2] however is likely to be wondering why they weren't able to win the game.
KEY-365648: [%team#1] go into their [%comp#1-long] match against [%team#2] on [%date#1-day] knowing that they will be roared on by a stadium filled to capacity at [%stadium#1]. [BRK_LN] Players know that home advantage plays a big part in such fixtures and [%person#1] will no doubt be telling his players to go out and give it everything for the [%team#1] fans.
KEY-365649: [%team#1] go into their vital [%comp#1-long] match against [%team#2] on [%date#1-day] knowing that they will be roared on by a stadium filled to capacity at [%stadium#1]. [BRK_LN] With the two nations very evenly matched, the players will know that they must make home advantage count and [%person#1] will no doubt be encouraging his players to go out and give it everything for the [%team#1] fans.
KEY-365659: [%team#1] officials have been left fuming after [%male#1] suffered [%injury#1] during [%team#3-short] match against [%team#2-short]. [%male#1-surname] faces up to [%time#1] on the sidelines as a result and tensions are set to escalate in the latest battle between club and country.
KEY-365661: [%team#1] pre-season woes have gone from bad to worse following the sensational news that [%male#1] will be out for up to [%time#1] with [%injury#1].

KEY-365665: [%team#2-short] have withdrawn the trade offer for [%team#1-short] [%cash#1] in Allocation funds.
KEY-365666: [%team#2-short] stunned the competition by beating [%team#3-short] last time out. Are you worried that their victory could give them a huge lift ahead of this match?
KEY-365667: [%team#2-short] recent away form hasn't been great but they are due a win on the road and perhaps playing at a neutral venue could suit them.
KEY-365697: {upper}[%number#6] games into life with [%team#1] and it's safe to say that [%person#1] has wasted little time in bringing fresh faces to [%stadium#1]. [BRK_LN] The [%manager_description#1] has signed [%number#9] players for a combined total of [%cash#1-roundlarge], including [%team_description#3] [%team#3-short] [%player_description#3] [%male#3].
KEY-365698: {upper}[%number#6] games into life with [%team#1] and it's safe to say that [%person#1] bid to overhaul the first-team squad at [%stadium#1] is well underway with no fewer than [%number#9] players arriving on free transfers since [%date#2-month]. [BRK_LN] [%person#1-surname] has sought to stamp his mark on the team and looks to be adept at raiding the transfer market for bargains.

KEY-375190: And I feel perfectly justified in doing that. I've had it from all angles over the course of this run and it's my turn to give a little back
KEY-375191: Another poor result for your team means your unfortunate record against [%person#2] continues. Why is it that you still can't beat him?
KEY-375192: Because I'm better than him, it's as simple as that
KEY-375193: Before the match I predicted a win for [%team#1-short]. They missed the twelfth man today but they came back strongly after a poor start. Their fans will be pleased that they managed to turn things around.

KEY-375380: [%club#1] players [%person_list#1] have decided to show their support and raise awareness for the [%charity#1-short] charity by growing moustaches during the month of November.
KEY-375381: [%comp#1-short] Expansion Draft
KEY-375396: [%male#1] will initially join on a Youth Contract on [%date#2] and will remain on that deal until his Full Contract begins on [%date#1].
KEY-375397: [%male#1] proposed transfer from [%team#1-short] to [%team#2-short] has been cancelled due to [%team#1-short] triggering an automatic contract extension clause within [%male#1-surname] contract.
KEY-375402: [%number#2] From [%number#1]
KEY-375403: [%number#2]+Gk From [%number#1]
KEY-375404: His new contract will start on [%date#2-long] and will keep him at the club until [%date#1-long].
KEY-375405: I appreciate it a lot and hope to be able to bring the same sort of success to the club that he did
KEY-375406: I bet [%person#2-first] won't be feeling too peachy after that. Let's see how he likes being on the losing side
KEY-375407: I built a squad for the future so [%person#2-first] shouldn't need to add any more players
KEY-375408: I can only focus on doing my job as well as I can. I suggest he does the same
KEY-375409: I can only keep on plugging away for a win when we go head-to-head, but otherwise it's just one match in a long season and I can't dwell on it
KEY-375410: I can see where he's coming from but I have faith in my ability
KEY-375411: I can understand where he's coming from but in order to achieve what I've set out to do I needed to make some changes
KEY-375412: I can't believe how quickly he's threatening to destroy all of the good work I did there
KEY-375414: I can't stand him and make a point of trying to avoid anything he has to say
KEY-375416: I didn't think he could be more lucky but I've been proven wrong again
KEY-375420: I don't know how you've drawn that conclusion from my comments
KEY-375421: I don't know what we have to do to win, we were good enough to do so today but instead we're going to have to put up with more nonsense from him aren't we?
KEY-375422: I don't like my reaction either but everybody has a breaking point I guess
KEY-375423: I don't need his help and the more he keeps talking about things here the harder my job becomes
KEY-375424: I don't particularly care what he has to say. He likes the sound of his own voice and I guess that suits you lot down to the ground
KEY-375425: I don't pay any attention to these records and what have you, but I thought we were well beaten today unfortunately
KEY-375426: I don't really know how much more he has to do to get a result against me
KEY-375428: I don't want to detract from the result at all, but on a personal level I'm pleased because, as well as the win, it might mean a moment's silence from [%person#2-surname] too!
KEY-375430: I fear that in the long-term he'll regret this. It doesn't take long for a team to be left behind by savvier managers
KEY-375431: I felt it was important to uphold the club's traditions and build from within. Evidently [%person#2-first] disagrees
KEY-375433: I guess it only goes to show that I'm a considerably better manager. I have no idea why they thought he was an adequate replacement for me
KEY-375434: I had little choice; the squad was threadbare in some areas
KEY-375435: I hate this fixture because every time it comes around we end up discussing [%person#2-surname] versus me and the distraction inevitably leads to another below-par performance and a disappointing result
KEY-375436: I have to find a way to lighten the mood when you lot in the media ask terrible questions every week
KEY-375437: I haven't any interest in what he has to say. His words aren't worth the paper they're written on
KEY-375438: I know from first-hand experience how hard it is to do well there and [%person#2-first] is doing a tremendous job building upon the foundations I left in place
KEY-375439: I know from first-hand experience how hard it is to do well there. [%person#2-first] is a good manager and knows he can always come to me for advice if he wants it
KEY-375440: I know how his teams tend to play and I know how to beat them
KEY-375441: I like to think we're cut from the same cloth and that this club is in as safe a pair of hands as it was under his stewardship
KEY-375442: I really don't know what else I have to do to finally get one over on [%person#2-surname]
KEY-375443: I really try not to pay any attention to it. It's driven simply by you lot in the media
KEY-375444: I tend to think statistics like these are given too much attention. He's far too good a manager for this to mean anything and will surely get his fair share of results
KEY-375445: I think [%person#2-first] has always had the better players. Managers can only do so much; the players are the ones who cross the white line and have to perform
KEY-375446: I think he's doing a great job. It's not easy to come into a club and stamp your mark on things immediately but he's done just that
KEY-375447: I think he's really beginning to lose it. He might claim the record doesn't get to him but based on some of the things he did today it clearly does
KEY-375449: I think we were easily the better team and deserved to win. [%person#2-surname] team were extremely fortunate
KEY-375450: I think you're reading too much into it. Have you ever come across a manager who enjoys losing?
KEY-375451: I thought we played as well as we could have but just didn't get the luck. Fair play to [%person#2-first] and his team
KEY-375452: I thought we played very well today but didn't quite get as much luck as we deserved to
KEY-375453: I thought we played well without reward. If we continue to play like that we will ultimately be successful both against [%person#2-surname] and overall
KEY-375454: I want to be my own manager and not have to rely on someone else's methods, but if I can pick up little bits and pieces from previous managers like [%person#2-first] then perhaps I should
KEY-375455: I want to win every match. It doesn't matter if it's against [%person#2-surname] or some other manager, I treat every opponent the same
KEY-375459: I wasn't aware that's what I was doing?
KEY-375460: I welcome his input as much as anyone else's at the club but I would prefer it to be constructive
KEY-375463: I wouldn't read too much into it, I'm still smarting after losing a game we should've won and will move on from it soon enough
KEY-375464: I wouldn't say that; it just feels good to get a win
KEY-375465: I wouldn't say there's a rivalry to speak of
KEY-375466: I'd be lying if I said it was easy today and perhaps we got the break of the ball a little bit more than we deserved. [%person#2-First] is a good manager and this record is hard to explain
KEY-375467: I'd give him time. It's always hard to replace a successful manager and he obviously has some ideas he wants to implement that will require a bit of patience
KEY-375468: I'd have done a lot better by now if he had left this club capable of competing
KEY-375469: I'd just like to move on and focus on the next match
KEY-375470: I'd rather move on and focus on something that actually matters
KEY-375471: I'll let him do the talking, it's all he ever seems to want to do
KEY-375472: I'll take his comments on board because he clearly knows what it takes to win here
KEY-375473: I'm confident of eventually beating him but that's not the be all and end all for me. I'm generally pleased with how the team performed today
KEY-375474: I'm delighted for the lads, they really played well today and deserved to win
KEY-375476: I'm dubious as to how long it'll last; I just don't think the squad is cut out to play this way long-term
KEY-375477: I'm fine, it's just a little frustrating to see us play so well without a reward
KEY-375478: I'm growing tired of this discussion. It obviously means more to him than it does to me so I suggest you speak to him about it
KEY-375479: I'm happy to lay that particular record to rest. Shall we leave it at that?
KEY-375480: I'm happy to see them doing well. [%person#2-first] is a capable manager and they're well set for the future with him in charge
KEY-375481: I'm hardly surprised, I left the club in such a good position that even a trained monkey could have found success after me!
KEY-375482: I'm just extremely pleased with our performance and with the result. We were truly excellent
KEY-375483: I'm merely standing my corner and making sure everybody's aware of who's the better manager
KEY-375484: I'm not really, it's just been a long time in coming and I've been very keen to break this particular barren streak
KEY-375485: I'm not sure what you're talking about
KEY-375486: I'm paid to win football matches. That's what we've done here and that's why I'm pleased
KEY-375487: I'm pleased to have earned his approval but ultimately I need to please the chairman here
KEY-375490: I'm really not sure how much it matters. Things change so much from game to game let alone over the longer term, [%person#2-surname] is just as capable of beating us as any other manager
KEY-375492: I'm surprised he knows what a capable tactician looks like!
KEY-375493: I've been unlucky whenever I've come up against him. You can prepare all you like but sometimes in this game you just need a slice of good fortune
KEY-375495: I've got better things to do than listen to his latest ramblings
KEY-375496: I've got better things to do than react to his juvenile baiting
KEY-375497: I've got more important things to worry about
KEY-375499: I've got to liven these discussions up a little bit haven't I?
KEY-375500: I've never been fortunate enough to be managing the stronger team and whilst that might sound like an excuse, it's also the truth
KEY-375501: I've never been too sure really. There must be a bit of luck in there somewhere because he's a good manager
KEY-375502: I've not had a single moment of luck and if [%person#2-first] tried to claim the opposite he'd be lying
KEY-375503: I've not really had time to digest it but I never paid much attention to the record anyway
KEY-375504: I've simply demonstrated yet again that I am the superior manager
KEY-375505: My job was made a lot easier by being able to come in with solid foundations in place. [%person#2-first] did a good job here and now I'm going to take the club to the next level
KEY-375506: My team gave him little choice but to humbly appreciate our performance. Perhaps he's not as good a manager as he might think?
KEY-375507: You do seem to be relishing this and rubbing his face in it once again. Why have you decided to adopt that approach?
KEY-375508: You don't seem to be taking this too well...
KEY-375509: You have a fantastic record against [%person#2] in your career. Why do you think that is?
KEY-375510: You have a pretty impressive record against [%person#2] in your career. Why do you think that is?
KEY-375511: You have what can only be described as a terrible record against [%person#2] in your career. Why have you found it so hard to beat him?
KEY-375512: You're especially pleased to have finally beaten him then?
KEY-375513: You've finally managed to get one over on [%person#2], congratulations. What is your immediate reaction to ending that particular streak?
KEY-375514: Your former [%team#2-short] team have been struggling of late and many have suggested that [%person#2] insistence on implementing a different tactical approach is costing the team. Do you have any thoughts on the situation?
KEY-375515: Your former [%team#2-short] team have been struggling somewhat since your departure. Do you have any thoughts on the job [%person#2] has done in succeeding you?
KEY-375516: Your impressive record against [%person#2] continues once again. Do you have any further thoughts on that particular rivalry?
KEY-375517: Your old club [%team#2-short] have been impressive of late and much of that appears to be down to [%person#2] implementing a different tactical approach. Do you have any thoughts on the job [%person#2] has done in succeeding you?
KEY-375518: Your old club [%team#2-short] have gone from strength to strength ever since your departure. Do you have any thoughts on the job [%person#2] has done in succeeding you?
KEY-375519: Your record against [%person#2] is no longer quite so impressive following that result. What is your reaction to the match?
KEY-375524: [%person#2-First] is one of the best managers in the game and has shown as much whenever we've clashed
KEY-375526: He deserves a lot of credit for making it work as quickly as he has
KEY-375527: He did a fine job here and if I can achieve half as much I'll be delighted
KEY-375528: He did things his way and I'll do things mine
KEY-375529: He doesn't know the first thing about actually managing. His solution is always to throw more money at a problem
KEY-375530: He gets far too much acclaim for doing an average job at best whilst I'm rarely afforded the same treatment. People need to see the truth
KEY-375531: He left me with a joke of a squad and I've had to bring it up to standard
KEY-375532: He left things in disarray here and I've been trying to clean up his mess. These comments are just an attempt to save face
KEY-375533: He seems to be convinced that he's capable of beating me and I just want to make sure he knows that's never going to happen
KEY-375534: He should focus on his current job; I don't need his help here
KEY-375535: He should've just picked up where I left things to be honest, it would have made his life much easier
KEY-375536: He'd like people to believe that! I don't think he as revered here as he'd like to think, put it that way
KEY-375538: He's a charlatan and is nowhere near the manager he thinks he is
KEY-375539: He's a good manager and I'm hardly the only one to struggle against him but I'm determined to put an end to it here
KEY-375540: He's a stain on our game and an embarrassment to my profession
KEY-375541: He's clearly a brilliant manager and he does tend to get the better of me. Hopefully my players can see to that this time around
KEY-375542: He's deluded. I had to undertake a considerable clean-up operation to get rid of the mess he left behind
KEY-375543: He's entitled to his opinion but I'm focusing on doing as good a job as I can right now
KEY-375544: He's got a nerve! I'd have had a much easier time of it were it not for the legacy of his incompetence
KEY-375545: He's had a lot to say after each of his victories over me so it's time I put a few words of my own on record
KEY-375546: He's had it coming for a long time and I'm glad to have put him in his place
KEY-375547: He's hardly qualified to talk about tactics. He should leave that stuff to people who actually know what they're talking about
KEY-375548: He's just afraid and I'm left trying to clean up the mess he made
KEY-375550: He's only able to spend freely because I went about things differently and allowed the club to build up a considerable balance
KEY-375551: He's responsible for most of the problems, they're only just coming to light now
KEY-375552: His voice still resonates strongly at this club so it's nice to have some influential support
KEY-375553: [%person#2] appeared gracious in defeat after you finally broke your personal hoodoo against his teams. How did you react to his comments?
KEY-375554: [%person#2] carries the hopes of a beleaguered fanbase with the prospect of emerging from administration tantalisingly close, and he knows that becoming the next [%job#1] comes with the responsibility of nursing the club towards a stable future.
KEY-375555: [%person#2] had some interesting things to say in response to once again failing to pick up a result against you. What are your thoughts on the matter?
KEY-375556: [%person#2] has displayed a proclivity for splashing the cash since replacing you at [%team#2-short], whereas you often appeared reluctant to spend. Do you have any thoughts on that?
KEY-375558: [%person#2] seemed to quite enjoy extending his impressive record over you judging by his latest comments. Do you have anything to say in response?
KEY-375559: [%person#2] spoke at length following a victory over your team which also saw the end of your unbeaten record against him personally. What are your thoughts on the affair?
KEY-375561: Your team will not actively participate in this draft since it is reserved for Expansion teams in order to help them to build their rosters.
KEY-375569: [%team#1-short] currently have amendments to the competition's squad selection rules.
KEY-375571: [%team#1-short] have been asked to protect [%number#1] players ahead of the Expansion Draft in order to prevent them from being eligible for selection.
KEY-375572: [%team#1-short] have played more than the max number of games in stage [%number#1] of [%comp#1-short]
KEY-375574: [%team#1-short] have shown their desire to make an impact by spending [%cash#1-long] in order to land [%number#1] year-old [%nation#1-nationality] [%position#1-lowercase] [%male#1] from [%team#2-short].
KEY-375575: [%team#1-short] haven't sent any players on loan to [%team#2-short] so far, meaning [%number#3] more players must be sent in order for the agreement to be respected.
KEY-375576: [%team#1-short] haven't sent any players on loan to [%team#2-short] so far, meaning one player must be sent in order for the agreement to be respected.
KEY-375586: [%team#1-short] will be asked to protect [%number#1] players on [%date#1-long] ahead of the Expansion Draft in order to prevent them from being eligible for selection.
KEY-375589: [%team#1-short] [%male#1] was controversially sent off in the [%number#1-nth] minute of [%scoreline#1-long].
KEY-375590: [%team#1-short] fans will have been delighted with the final score at [%stadium#1] today. They delivered after going behind, turning things around in impressive fashion.
KEY-375596: [%team#1] will not actively participate in this draft as they are a future Expansion team and are not currently a part of the league.
KEY-375597: [%team#1] will not actively participate in this draft as they are one of a number of future Expansion teams not currently a part of the league.
KEY-375598: [%team#1] will not actively participate in this draft since it is reserved for Expansion teams in order to help them to build their rosters.
KEY-375599: [%team#2-short] must now agree contract terms with [%male#1-surname] after drafting him in order to complete the signing.
KEY-375600: [%team#2-short] were expected to win this one comfortably and their fans will be delighted that they've gone on to secure mathematical survival.
KEY-375606: [%team#2-short], your former team, have been considerably more frugal since your departure with [%person#2] apparently reluctant to splash the cash. Do you have any thoughts on the matter?
KEY-375607: matches in a row without conceding a goal

KEY-375688: Discipline Rules For Team
KEY-375692: Estimated Trade Values
KEY-375919: My goalkeeping performances have been solid over the last few matches. I'm not sure where your criticism is coming from.
KEY-375923: My passing in recent games has been excellent. I think you'll find I'm one of the key players in terms of helping the team retain possession.
KEY-375944: Our strikers have been feeding off scraps in recent games. It is your job to create chances for them; you need to start creating more if you want to keep your place in this squad.
KEY-375961: Shall we see how [%person#2-first] likes it now the boot's on the other foot? I can't wait to hear his post-match reaction
KEY-375964: Silence my criticism with some strong performances then. Show me why you deserve to be part of this team.
KEY-375965: Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. The team could always do with more goals. I shouldn't have taken it out on you.
KEY-375967: Stop trying to blame others for your performances. Take responsibility for your own game and look to reduce the number of mistakes you're making.
KEY-375981: Thanks, I appreciate you letting me know about the specific squad selection rules that apply to the team.
KEY-375986: That's a fair point. I appreciate that the rest of the team need to chip in to allow you the chance to score more goals.
KEY-375992: The 'Focus' is what your team will work on every week, and the 'Intensity' specifies the amount of effort you want your players to put into it.
KEY-375994: The [%team_description#1] had not expected to get further than the [%fixture_name#2-nocomp], so they will be very happy to still be in the competition.
KEY-376019: The play-off final is a massive chance to win promotion and take [%team#2-short] to the next level, go out there and give your all to make the most of this opportunity.
KEY-376024: The team needs greater impetus; I need you to start playing in a more direct manner. Your performances recently haven't been good enough.
KEY-376028: There's definitely room for improvement; as a unit we need to be stronger in the air. It would be great if you could work on any possible improvements.
KEY-376032: This doesn't tie into the reason you gave for accepting the loan. I can't help but feel like you're trying to appease me so I won't complain.
KEY-376034: Threatening me with the transfer list is very poor and completely demotivating. I've made a lot of passes, the occasional mistake is bound to happen.
KEY-376035: Toggling whether terms are negotiable or not is a bold move but one which will lead to a decision being reached there and then. If you're confident in holding the upper hand in negotiations and feel the need to be assertive, setting this to 'Non-Negotiable' may force the other parties into accepting terms without daring to negotiate further.

KEY-378302: [%male#2] has steadfastly defended your decision to side with [%male#4] against criticism from [%male#3] and has reportedly lashed out at his team-mate for being so outspoken. Are you pleased to have the backing of players like him or does this open up the potential for a divided dressing room?
KEY-378303: [%male#2] is clearly unhappy at being forced out of [%team#1-short] and there are rumours of extensive discontent amongst the rest of the squad as a result of the situation. How do you intend to handle this?
KEY-378317: [%male#2] reaction to not being allowed to sign for [%team#1-short] despite being on the transfer list saw the player reiterate his frustration in public. Do you have anything to say about that?
KEY-378329: [%male#3-first] is handling this affair with professionalism and grace whilst [%male#2-first] continues to act like a child. If he doesn't want to be here I certainly won't lose any sleep when he leaves
KEY-378334: I believe his work here is far from done. There's a lot we still want to do and we have a much better chance of doing that with him at the club
KEY-378335: I can't believe we're talking about this in public; things have become that farcical. [%male#2-first] should get on with the job he's paid to do
KEY-378336: I can't force him to stay if he feels that strongly about it. It won't do anybody any good and keeping an unhappy player has the potential to develop into a much bigger problem
KEY-378337: I can't force him to stay if he really doesn't feel at home here. It won't do anybody any good and keeping an unhappy player has the potential to develop into a much bigger problem
KEY-378338: I can't pretend things have been easy but that's management for you; I hope to stay here for a long time yet
KEY-378339: I completely understand his issues and know it can't be easy to have to adapt like this but it won't be forever and he's very much filling a position of need for us at this point in time
KEY-378340: I could probably have handled things a bit differently but it's something I'll discuss with [%male#2-first] in private
KEY-378341: I don't agree with his decision to go public with his concerns and it won't have helped his case but he's in line to receive some sort of upgrade for sure
KEY-378342: I don't care to be brutally honest with you; I have plenty of other things to get on with whilst he figures out whether he wants to act like an adult
KEY-378343: I don't care what he wants; he's a [%team#1-short] player and unless we receive a remarkable bid for him it'll stay that way
KEY-378344: I don't care what he wants; he's a [%team#1-short] player and unless we receive a remarkable bid for him it'll stay that way
KEY-378345: I don't care what he wants; he's a [%team#1-short] player and unless we receive a suitable bid for him it'll stay that way
KEY-378346: I don't consider it a risk because the players have given me no reason to. They're happy, confident and determined to succeed
KEY-378347: I don't know why he thinks it's any of his business; this is between [%male#3-first] and the club
KEY-378349: I don't see it as [%person#1] vs [%person#2]. Twenty-two players on the pitch decide the result.
KEY-378350: I don't think it's likely right now. He's got a better chance of playing here than he has of featuring regularly elsewhere
KEY-378353: I don't want a disruptive influence in the dressing room if I can help it so I'll certainly give him the opportunity to have his concerns heard
KEY-378354: I don't want this becoming a problem; any player wishing to speak to me about their concerns knows where my office is
KEY-378355: I don't want this dragging on for very long as it could easily affect our performances on the pitch. I'll be talking to the players themselves in the very near future and we will sort this out
KEY-378356: I expect my players to follow me unconditionally. If anyone wants to step out of line they can face the consequences
KEY-378357: I expect he'll eventually leave but right now I haven't had a suitable offer for him
KEY-378358: I felt it was the right thing to do and it's always good when it's received well by superb professionals like [%male#2-first]. We have a strong squad and that gives me the confidence to make tough decisions
KEY-378359: I felt it was the right thing to say and it's always good when it's received well by superb professionals like [%male#2-first]. We have a strong squad and that gives me the confidence to make tough decisions
KEY-378360: I found his reaction rather disappointing and I now have to question whether he's the type of player we want at this football club
KEY-378361: I have no reason to be concerned. This is very much an isolated incident and the rest of the squad seem perfectly happy in their careers right now
KEY-378365: I have the full backing of the board and have no reason to think I won't be in charge for years to come
KEY-378366: I have the full backing of the board and no reason to be concerned
KEY-378367: I hope he's learned his lesson and that we can move on to more positive things
KEY-378368: I hope to see it light a fire under him. He needs to step up his game and do something to get noticed for the right reasons
KEY-378369: I know what he wants but I have little intention of allowing that to happen
KEY-378370: I know where he's coming from and I'll definitely speak to him again about it. We both want what's best for the club at the end of the day
KEY-378371: I made what I felt to be the right decision for the team. If [%male#2-first] wants to leave because of it I won't stand in his way
KEY-378372: I see no benefit in allowing him to leave right now; he's a [%team#1-short] player and unless we receive a very good bid for him he'll remain as such
KEY-378373: I should think we'll field a few bids for him and then decide what's best for the club
KEY-378374: I stand by the decision but that doesn't mean that I think any less of him as a player. I desperately want him to stay at the club
KEY-378375: I still need him to contribute. He still has a big role to play for us
KEY-378376: I suppose there's always going to be those who disagree with a course of action and it's my job as manager to ensure that any concerns are met head-on and dealt with swiftly
KEY-378377: I suppose there's always going to be those who disagree with how I go about things and it's my job as manager to ensure that any concerns are met head-on and dealt with swiftly
KEY-378378: I think enough has been said about this matter now, it's time to move on
KEY-378379: I think he could do that by staying but he's obviously more concerned so we'll have to consider our options
KEY-378380: I think he could eventually find what he wants here but if he can't wait that long then maybe we'll have to make something happen
KEY-378381: I think he stands a decent shot just by staying up with us but if his mind is made up then maybe we'll have to make something happen
KEY-378382: I think he'd be a key player in our attempts to bounce back with immediate promotion but if he wants out there's not a great deal we can do
KEY-378383: I think he's best served by staying here right now. He'd struggle to enjoy his football elsewhere
KEY-378384: I think he's best served by staying here right now. Who knows when an opportunity will arise?
KEY-378385: I think he's best served by staying here right now. I don't know why he wants to go and play there anyway
KEY-378386: I think he's got a point but it's not as if I'm not trying to bring new faces into the club
KEY-378387: I think it has value and I'm confident we can continue in the same fashion, yes
KEY-378388: I think it shows how ambitious the majority of the squad here is. They recognise talent when they see it and they don't want to see the team weakened by unnecessary departures
KEY-378389: I think it's a fair and honest value for what he offers to any prospective buyer
KEY-378390: I think it's clear that [%male#3-first] deserves a new contract at this stage; even his team-mates are willing to fight his corner!
KEY-378391: I think it's probably fair to allow him to move if he feels that strongly about it
KEY-378392: I think they're terrific; they encapsulate what the competition is all about and I'm sure everyone will be tuning in to watch
KEY-378395: I thought it showed that opportunities are available to those who deserve them, not those who shout the loudest. [%male#2-first] knows what it takes to succeed at this club
KEY-378396: I try to act fairly and judiciously when dealing with the squad but if poor delicate flowers like [%male#2-first] feel as though I'm being unfair then perhaps they should seek gainful employment elsewhere
KEY-378397: I understand where [%male#2-first] is coming from and he deserves to have things investigated but it's important that we as a club do everything in our power to bring this to a peaceful conclusion
KEY-378398: I understand where [%male#2-first] is coming from but it's important that we as a club do everything in our power to bring this to a peaceful conclusion
KEY-378399: I understand where he's coming from but I want him to help us become the big club he clearly wants to play for
KEY-378400: I understand where he's coming from but I'd rather see him stay here and help lead us onto that stage instead
KEY-378401: I want my players to be committed and passionate about the club. Anybody who isn't knows where the door is
KEY-378402: I want a squad that wants to play for this club and if that means losing a few malcontents then so be it
KEY-378403: I want him to be a big part of my plans for this team but it appears he'd rather take the easy way out
KEY-378404: I want him to be a part of a strong and successful squad here, not elsewhere
KEY-378405: I want him to fight for his place here and not seek it elsewhere. I'm extremely reluctant to sell him
KEY-378406: I want him to lead us towards success here. I'm extremely reluctant to sell him
KEY-378407: I want him to lead us towards that level of football and not seek it elsewhere. I'm extremely reluctant to sell him
KEY-378408: I want him to stay at the club and unless somebody makes us a very attractive offer he's going nowhere
KEY-378409: I want to see him double his efforts to impress and earn his way back into the team
KEY-378411: I was pleased to hear those comments from [%male#2-first] but I wasn't surprised because he's a wonderful professional. We have a strong squad and his attitude is exactly what we need to turn things around
KEY-378412: I was simply gauging what we might be able to get for him on the open market. It doesn't mean we're getting rid of him
KEY-378413: I will go on record right now as saying that he's not getting one at this moment in time and his behaviour has harmed his chances of ever getting one
KEY-378414: I will live and die by the decisions I make. That's the life of a manager and I wouldn't have it any other way
KEY-378415: I will never completely shut the door on a player, even if he's transfer listed. There's always a chance for someone like [%male#2-first] to work hard enough and fight his way back into the fold
KEY-378416: I will not tolerate players who attempt to undermine my authority. Anyone who wants to try can feel free to step up and find out just how serious I am
KEY-378417: I won't be dictated to by any player of mine. If anyone has a problem with a decision I've made they can come to see me about it and we'll decide that I was right
KEY-378418: I won't be granting a loan move, he'll benefit more from staying at this point in his career
KEY-378420: I'd like him to stay really. I'm extremely reluctant to sell him but things have gone too far to think about going back now
KEY-378421: I'd much prefer him to stay and help take us to the next level but if his mind is made up then maybe we'll have to make something happen
KEY-378422: I'd much prefer him to stay but things have gone too far for that to happen so I expect he'll eventually find the right move
KEY-378423: I'd question his ambition and commitment if he's unable to recognise the importance of a loan spell at this stage of his career
KEY-378424: I'd rather none of it came out in the first place to be honest, it hardly shows the club in a good light
KEY-378425: I'd rather none of it had happened in the first place to be honest
KEY-378426: I'll be looking to resolve this mess as quickly as possible and if that means asking for his opinion on things first so be it
KEY-378427: I'll be looking to resolve this mess as quickly as possible and if that means bringing in one or two fresh faces then so be it
KEY-378428: I'll be looking to resolve this mess as quickly as possible and if that means giving him certain assurances then I will
KEY-378429: I'll be trying to get rid of him as quickly as possible
KEY-378430: I'll treat each situation on its own merits. If that means taking a much sterner approach to another problem then that's what I'll do
KEY-378431: I'm beyond caring about what he wants. As a matter of principle I won't be giving in to his petulant demands
KEY-378432: I'm disappointed that he's chosen to express his concerns in this manner and at the end of the day if he doesn't want to be here then I won't force him to stay
KEY-378433: I'm extremely reluctant to sell him and our valuation reflects the esteem in which we hold him
KEY-378434: I'm happy with the squad and if he doesn't want to be a part of it then so be it. I don't want a player who doesn't want to be here
KEY-378435: I'm happy with the squad. He'd do well to remember he's a part of it and nothing more
KEY-378436: I'm in charge and I'll decide if and when he leaves
KEY-378437: I'm in charge at this club and [%male#2-first] would do well to remember that
KEY-378438: I'm keen to keep him and if it means sitting down to thrash out a new deal then I'm happy to do that
KEY-378439: I'm looking for a lot more from him before we can talk about a new contract
KEY-378440: I'm lucky enough to work with a tremendous group of individuals who have become a close-knit team. They understand why I've made this decision and as far as I know they endorse it
KEY-378441: I'm not especially fearful of any problems rising up from this situation, the players all know where they stand and we're already focusing on the next match
KEY-378442: I'm not going to be discussing my future here today
KEY-378443: I'm not going to be discussing tactics with all of you here today
KEY-378444: I'm not going to be discussing transfer dealings with all of you here today, sorry
KEY-378445: I'm not quite sure what he's so unhappy about, he needs to act like an adult and focus on his job
KEY-378446: I'm not quite sure what he's so unhappy about. It's very much something over nothing as far as I'm concerned
KEY-378447: I'm not sure that those were grounds for being offered new terms
KEY-378448: I'm paid to manage a group of very talented players who each come with a unique personality. It's not an easy job at times but that's half the fun of it and really, there's nothing for anyone to worry about
KEY-378449: I'm paid to win football matches, not pander to [%male#2-first]. If he'd rather play elsewhere then he's free to leave
KEY-378450: I'm paid to win football matches, not pander to [%male#2-first]. If he's not on board with my approach then he doesn't serve a useful purpose
KEY-378451: I'm prepared to consider something providing it's good for the club
KEY-378452: I'm sure his initial reaction will pass and he'll come to his senses. A loan move is exactly what he needs right now
KEY-378453: I'm sure we'll be sitting down to discuss the best possible destination for him to go on loan, and I hope he wants to be a part of that process
KEY-378454: I'm sympathetic to his issues but I think he can still achieve so much here
KEY-378455: I'm sympathetic to his issues but I truly feel he'd be best served by staying here. The club has a strong support network and we want to help him in any way we can
KEY-378456: I'm the manager and what I say goes. There's nothing else to say
KEY-378457: I'm tired of hearing it. Everyone involved in the affair should focus their attentions on playing football
KEY-378458: I'm willing to give him the playing time he wants providing he proves himself deserving of it
KEY-378459: I've always believed that a player should honour the contract they sign and that's what I expect of [%male#2-first] now
KEY-378460: I've asked him to play there and that's the end of the matter. I'm in charge, not him
KEY-378461: I've been given no reason to fear for my job. I often have tough decisions to make and have been given the freedom to make them without questioning how it affects my future here
KEY-378462: I've been thinking about it for a while and I'm not sure it's what he needs right now, but I'm still prepared to reconsider
KEY-378463: I've chosen a tactical approach that I feel is in the best interests of the team and I expect players like [%male#2-first] to act professionally and get on with whatever's asked of them
KEY-378464: I've chosen to do what's right for the squad. If we don't have a group of players who are happy in their jobs then we're never going to achieve our goals
KEY-378465: I've got little interest in whatever he has to say on the matter, it's none of his business
KEY-378466: I've got more important things to worry about. There are players who want to be here and want to give their all for the club; we should be talking about them
KEY-378467: I've got nothing to say on the subject at this time
KEY-378468: I've got nothing to worry about. You lot love to sensationalise things but there's nothing going on here that doesn't happen at clubs up and down the country all the time
KEY-378469: I've got to hold my hands up and admit to not dealing with this as well as I could have. It's time to move on
KEY-378470: I've spoken to him about this a little already; he does make some valid points but at the same time he has to understand that I can only do what's right for this club
KEY-378471: My role as manager demands strong leadership and unwavering confidence in my beliefs. I'm prepared to stand firm in the face of dissent if anybody wants to question my choices
KEY-378472: You are unable to offer a collective squad win bonus for domestic cup competitions due to the limited prize money available in these competitions.
KEY-378475: You have a rather sensitive situation on your hands with [%male#2] none too happy after [%male#3] reportedly missed training recently. How do you intend to handle things?
KEY-378476: You have a rather sensitive situation on your hands with [%male#2] reportedly being unhappy following a training ground incident involving [%male#3]. How do you intend to handle things?
KEY-378477: You have a rather sensitive situation on your hands with a reported dislike between [%male#2] and [%male#3]. How do you intend to handle things?
KEY-378478: You have a rather sensitive situation on your hands with a reported falling out between [%male#2] and [%male#3]. How do you intend to handle things?
KEY-378479: You have approached [%male#2-surname] in an attempt to try to help resolve [%male#3-surname] unhappiness.
KEY-378480: Your decision to drop [%male#2] has caused a bit of a stir. Why have you left him out?
KEY-378481: Your decision to fine [%male#2] for being sent off hasn't gone down well with him. What happens next?
KEY-378482: Your decision to fine [%male#2] for poor performance hasn't gone down well with him. What happens next?
KEY-378483: Your decision to fine [%male#2] for unprofessional behaviour hasn't gone down well with him. What happens next?

KEY-378769: I think it's a bit unrealistic to be thinking about winning the MLS Cup this time around.

KEY-379325: The boss is right, we can do this if we all give it one hundred percent out there.
KEY-379360: The season has finished now and it's time to focus on what we can achieve going forward. I think we can win the MLS Cup next year and you need to come back for pre-season with the same level of ambition.

KEY-379380: The win gives [%person#1-surname] another event to add to a career full of memorable moments, although perhaps none will be greater than seeing son [%male#2-first] come through the [%team#2-short] academy whilst working there back in [%date#1].
KEY-379381: The win gives [%person#1-surname] another event to add to a career full of memorable moments, although perhaps none will be greater than seeing son [%male#2-first] join the club's academy in [%date#1].
KEY-379384: The writing had been on the wall for [%person#1-surname] for some time, with reports of a final warning from the club emerging earlier in the season, and very few pundits have expressed surprise at today's news.
KEY-379419: This latest award gives [%person#1-surname] another event to add to a career full of memorable moments, although perhaps none will be greater than seeing son [%male#2-first] come through the [%team#2-short] academy whilst working there back in [%date#1].
KEY-379420: This latest award gives [%person#1-surname] another event to add to a career full of memorable moments, although perhaps none will be greater than seeing son [%male#2-first] join the club's academy in [%date#1].
KEY-379421: This latest award serves to confirm [%person#1-surname] place amongst the managerial elite following his ascent into the hall of fame back in [%date#1] and further establishes him as one of the best to ever take to the dugout.
KEY-379423: This run of consistent good form only serves to confirm [%person#1-surname] place amongst the managerial elite following his ascent into the hall of fame whilst with [%team#2-short] back in [%date#1] and further establishes him as one of the best to ever take to the dugout.
KEY-379424: This run of consistent good form serves to confirm [%person#1-surname] place amongst the managerial elite following his ascent into the hall of fame back in [%date#1] and further establishes him as one of the best to ever take to the dugout.
KEY-379706: I think I've underestimated us, we should be aiming to qualify for the [%comp#3-short] if everyone can show as much ambition as some of you clearly are.
KEY-379707: I think I've underestimated us, we should be aiming to win the Final Series if everyone can show as much ambition as some of you clearly are.

KEY-379709: I think I've underestimated us, we should be aiming to win the title if everyone can show as much ambition as some of you clearly are.
KEY-379714: I think it's the best thing to do for the team right now. His departure will allow us more flexibility to strengthen the squad.
KEY-379718: I think that's rather pathetic to be honest; some of you need to develop thicker skins and understand that we're in an unforgiving business here.
KEY-380118: Allocation Funds represent an amount of money MLS teams are allowed to use in order to sign players and/or allocate their salaries (or a proportion of them) to in order to conform to the salary cap.
KEY-380156: Come off it, there wasn't any malice intended. [%male#3-first] isn't that sort of person.
KEY-380169: Draft Picks are allocated in reverse order of the season's final standings and are used on the best young prospects in the annual MLS SuperDraft. When trading for draft picks for future seasons you are effectively gambling on a team's finishing position based on your perception of their strengths and weaknesses.
KEY-380181: European Nation Coefficient (descending)
KEY-380653: International slots allow for the limited inclusion of non-domestic players in MLS squads. Each team begins with an allocation of slots which can then be used as tradable assets if they so wish.
KEY-380766: Okay, I can see I'm not going to change your mind. I'll offer you out and we'll see what happens.
KEY-380768: Okay, I can't risk any unrest in the dressing room so I'll offer you out, hopefully this deal can still be salvaged.
KEY-380790: Over the course of your career you will have the opportunity to further shape and improve your managerial profile; for example, you might wish to progress through the various Coaching Badges available to you.
KEY-380792: Past Playing Experience indicates your standing in the game as a player and by selecting a greater level of experience you will receive an allocation of points commensurate with your standing within the game.
KEY-380793: Pay close attention to the reactions of each player to your overall team talk before embarking upon individual comments. Players who have reacted positively might not need anything further said to them but those with concerns can often be talked around.
KEY-380794: Perhaps you're right; there's no point continuing this discussion if no good is going to come of it. I'll accept your comments and move on.
KEY-380798: Player Rights involve the exclusive negotiation rights for players not currently contracted to an MLS team.  You will need to hold the rights of any domestic player playing outside of the league before you are allowed to try to sign them to a contract.
KEY-380800: Players are ranked in the drop-down lists by your assistant manager's evaluation of their suitability for the job. Captains and vice-captains are selected in a pre-season news item whilst all potential stand-ins are selected by dragging and dropping names from the left side of the screen to the panel on the right.
KEY-380809: Primarily, you can change the formation by clicking, dragging and releasing any of the shirt icons into another area of the pitch. Available positions are made clear by the presence of a darkened silhouette shirt icon.
KEY-380810: Priority dictates how urgent the assignment is. If you need a quick turnaround from the scout, set it as 'Very Urgent' otherwise you should leave it as 'Normal'.
KEY-380812: Pros and Cons cover the positive and negative aspects of a player as he's scouted. As your knowledge of him increases, more and more Pros and Cons will be listed as the report becomes more comprehensive.
KEY-380813: Queued Assignments reflect the number of arrangements that are on hold pending the availability of a scout currently out on a different assignment. The same applies to 'Queued Players' whenever there is a request made to scout them from their individual profiles.
KEY-380830: Rest options are not available to managers of semi-pro or amateur teams due to the limitations in the number of days they are actually available to train.
KEY-380831: Scope determines exactly where you want your scout to look for the requested talent, ranging from Worldwide down to a specific competition within a nation.
KEY-380833: Scouting regions will increase your chances of finding more players outside of active competitions in your save game.
KEY-380835: Select to mark this as negotiable
KEY-380836: Selecting a nation as Playable will allow you to interact fully with it whilst those nations picked as Viewable only will be restricted to running in a reduced manner without full use of the match engine. You are also unable to manage in Viewable countries.
KEY-380837: Seriously, I think you should drop this. You've been banned and we need a captain who can lead by example. I suggest you take some time to consider why you were banned in the first place.
KEY-380843: So because of a handful of poor performances you're willing to completely write me off as a player, I'm not sure that I want to stay at the club if that's the case.
KEY-380845: Some of the lads feel you were wrong to dismiss [%male#3-first] concerns over the sale of [%male#4]; he was such an important player for us that it defied belief you would let him go.
KEY-380846: Sometimes the best thing for your career is to be a big fish in a small pond. Stay here, stand out and you'll have a much better chance of getting a cap than you would if you were surrounded by better players.
KEY-380850: Sorry boss, this got way out of hand, I can see that I've let myself down here, I'll knuckle down and prove to you that I'm worth the hassle.
KEY-380855: Star Ratings have an 'uncertainty' factor applied to them for players you're unfamiliar with or haven't scouted fully. The longer you scout a player, the narrower the range of uncertainty will become, which in turn will allow you to get a better idea of how good he is.
KEY-380856: Stars show how good a member of your backroom team thinks a player is in comparison to your current squad. The star rating might differ depending on who you ask as some coaches and scouts are better than others.
KEY-380858: Tackling can be requested in three severities; Normal, Easy and Hard. 'Normal' offers no specific instruction and allows a player to use his own appropriate style whilst 'Easy' will request that opponents are given as little reason as possible to find fault with challenges. 'Hard' tackling can be used to make a statement of physical superiority but runs the risk of players receiving disciplinary action from the match officials.
KEY-380873: Thanks boss, I'm going to make the most of this opportunity, you won't have any choice but to play me regularly after you've seen what I can do.
KEY-380880: Thanks for letting me know how you feel, but while there are no bids on the table, there's no point discussing this further. Let's just wait and see what happens.
KEY-380881: Thanks for sorting that loan move for me boss, it was a really valuable experience but I'm back now and feel more ready than ever to be starting matches here. Can you give me assurances that I'm going to get the football I need soon?
KEY-380884: That might not seem realistic now but I'm planning on bringing in some very exciting transfer targets. If you can stick around until I've made the signings I want then I think you'll want to stay.
KEY-380889: That was then and this is now, you can't just write me off based on a few poor performances, I don't really see why I'd stay at the club based on that.
KEY-380892: That would do it, I'll stay provided that I'm made an offer that is too good to turn down. I'm willing to make life here very difficult for you if I don't get what I want.
KEY-380894: That would keep me here; it's going to cost you a lot though, make sure it's a good offer. I'm willing to make life here very difficult for you if I don't get what I want.
KEY-380895: That would tempt me for sure, you're going to need to make me a very good offer though as I'm willing to make you're life here very difficult in order to get what I want.
KEY-380897: That's a decent point, some of the kids are looking very promising, I'm willing to stay for a year to see if they can kick on and help us match my ambitions.
KEY-380898: That's a decent point, some of the kids are looking very promising. I'm willing to stay for a year to see if they can kick on and help us match my ambitions.
KEY-380903: That's a fair point, you can hardly show an improvement without playing, I've been very clear about what I expect you to work on and will give you a chance to show that you've got what it takes in the next few matches.
KEY-380905: That's a good point, I remember how valuable it was having older players around when I was starting my career. I'd love to provide that to some of the youngsters here as well.
KEY-380911: That's all I needed to hear, you could have avoided a lot of trouble by just giving me what I wanted in the first place.
KEY-380912: That's all well and good but I can't exactly address it when I'm not playing can I, I'll just have to find a new club that trusts me to improve as I play.
KEY-380916: That's completely fair enough, I understand where you're coming from and I don't want to lose you, you can expect to see yourself in the first-team very soon.
KEY-380921: That's easy for you to say, try to look at it from my point of view. I have to look after myself and a move like this is just too good to turn down. I want to leave and that's final.
KEY-380922: That's easy to say when you're not being underpaid like I am, talk to me about a new contract or you're going to lose me as a chance like this doesn't come around that often.
KEY-380923: That's easy to say when you're not being underpaid like I am. Talk to me about a new contract or you're going to lose me as a chance like this doesn't come around that often.
KEY-380924: That's easy to say when you're not in a position to be turning it down, I want this move and that's final.
KEY-380926: That's fair enough I guess. I'll see what happens over the next few days but I thought it best to let you know where I stand. I will want to discuss this further if you block the move though.
KEY-380927: That's fair enough boss, it's good to know you've actually got your reasons for not selecting me, I'll wait for my chance and make sure I take it when it comes around.
KEY-380928: That's fair enough but I need a chance to address the issues you've raised. Pick me for the next few matches and I promise to show you that I've taken your criticism on board.
KEY-380930: That's fair enough, I just thought letting you know how I felt was the professional thing to do. I'm happy to accept what you've said though.
KEY-380949: That's good of you to offer but unfortunately the only real solution to my issue is to move on and there's nothing you can really do to change that.
KEY-380952: That's it. You're going to be training with the kids for the foreseeable future, I am not going to put up with threats from anyone let alone one of my players. The deal is off, you're going nowhere.
KEY-380953: That's just a convenient excuse. Now would be the perfect time to play me, the confidence of the team would help me reach their level, if you're not willing to take a chance on me then I'll have to move on.
KEY-380954: That's just not going to cut it, I can make life here very difficult for you, I'm more than prepared to kick up a fuss to get what I want.
KEY-380955: That's just not going to happen, I thought I'd be able to talk some sense into you but I see now that I can't. The sooner we can get shot of you the better as far as I'm concerned.
KEY-380956: That's just not good enough, you need to understand that players have a lot more power these days. I'll gladly make life very difficult for you unless I get the games I deserve.
KEY-380957: That's nonsense and you know it, there's no way we can lose one of our stars and be better off as a team, the sooner you admit you've made a mistake here the better.
KEY-380958: That's nonsense, I've been fit for long enough to be playing now. You're just looking for excuses not to play me. I'll instruct my agent to find me a new club if you won't give me the football I need.
KEY-380959: That's nonsense, if I'm good off the bench there's no reason I wouldn't be good from the start and I might have to start looking for a move if you're not going to give me a chance to prove that.
KEY-380960: That's not fair, I can't be judged on those performances when it's obvious you'd already made up your mind to drop me again after them. I'll have to look for another club if you're not going to give me another chance.
KEY-380961: That's not going to be regular enough for me, I need to be starting league games. I'd prefer to be starting them here but I'd still gladly take a loan move.
KEY-380966: That's not going to happen I'm afraid, you're just going to have to take my word for it and that's all I have to say about the matter.
KEY-380967: That's not going to happen I'm afraid. It's up to me how I manage my team and I don't appreciate complaints, especially from inexperienced members of the squad like you.
KEY-380969: That's not good enough I'm afraid, I know I'm young but you're just using that as an excuse. I'm ready for football and I'm willing to make your life here very difficult in order to get the move I need.
KEY-380971: That's not good enough, there aren't nearly enough cup fixtures to give me the football I need. You have to let me leave and that's final.
KEY-380972: That's not good enough, we all know that the cups are just a chance to rest the first-team these days. Whether it's here or at another club, I need to be playing regularly at this stage of my career.
KEY-380973: That's ridiculous, the offer was perfectly fine, you're just looking for excuses to keep me here and I'm not having it. You'll have a dressing room revolt on your hands once I've spoken to the rest of the lads if you don't let me go.
KEY-380974: That's settled then, I won't be renewing my contract and will leave on a free. Thanks boss, I've loved my time here and it's good to know I'm going to be leaving with my relationship with the club intact.
KEY-380976: That's totally out of order, I'm more than good enough to play for this club, and the fact you can't recognise that is the main reason I want to leave.
KEY-380977: That's totally out of order, I'm more than good enough to play for this club. All you've done is make me all the more determined to prove you wrong, I'm going to stay here and force you to pick me on merit.

KEY-380983: The Duration section deals with how long you want the scout to look for talent.

KEY-380984: The Match Controls allow you to tailor the experience to your own personal preferences; from the speed of the action to the camera you watch it from.

KEY-380987: The Negotiable lock indicates that you are open to discussion on the terms of any proposed transfer. If you aren't and want your terms met exactly, ensure this is set to Non-Negotiable.
KEY-380988: The New Stadium unlockable is a great way to boost your attendances and stadium capacity without having to pay out of your existing club bank balance for the stadium.
KEY-380989: The Offer Type can be one of a number of typical choices. By default, you have the standard 'Transfer' option. Depending on the player and the club, different types are represented.
KEY-380993: The Tactics Creator will guide you through creating and developing a new tactic in a step-by-step approach. Before you dive in, here are a few things to consider:
KEY-380994: The Transfer offer is most commonly used and involves offering a cash sum (although occasionally a bid of zero will elicit a positive response) in order to acquire a player's services.
KEY-381120: Trade Offers are exclusive to MLS and involve the exchange of assorted league-specific assets such as draft picks, International slots and Allocation Funds.
KEY-381126: Transfers for League Rights are specific to MLS and involve acquiring the right to a player's ownership whilst he remains contracted to a non-MLS team. It affords you the exclusive right to bring him to the league should he wish to play there.
KEY-381239: You need to ask yourself if you really want to go or if this is all just in the heat of the moment, I've got no intention of keeping players who don't want to be here so if you want to leave now would be a good time to tell me.
KEY-381240: You need to be more willing to dribble in matches, you've barely taken on any full backs in recent matches and it's something you need to address to get back in the side.
KEY-381241: You need to be patient, this is a long season and I'm going to need to make full use of my squad, you'll get your chance.
KEY-381242: You need to improve the accuracy of your crosses, we rely on you to create chances but your delivery has been too wayward recently, you need to improve on it to get back in the side.
KEY-381243: You need to involve your team-mates more often, you're guilty of thinking you're the main man and trying to do everything yourself. If you can't play as part of a team then you won't be playing regularly here.
KEY-381244: You need to learn that as a winger your decision making is crucial, sometimes attempting to take on your full back is the best option but in recent matches that's all you seem to have been doing, your dribbling just hasn't been effective though and needs to improve if you want to get back in the side.
KEY-381245: You need to learn when to release the ball, you've been trying to take your full backs on way too often in recent matches and the majority of your dribbles just haven't been successful, try to work on that and you'll be back in the side.
KEY-381247: You need to view reserve football as a chance to impress me, I'll be watching your performances at that level very closely and if you're performing at a high enough level I'll give you a chance.
KEY-381248: You need to view reserve football as a chance to impress me. I'll be watching your performances very closely and if you're performing at a high enough level I'll register you for [%comp#3] football at the next available opportunity.
KEY-381249: You need to work on your heading, a striker in my side needs to be able to win his fair share of aerial duels and get headers in on goal, you're just not doing that enough for my liking.
KEY-381250: You obviously just haven't got what it takes to be at this club if you're looking for a way out instead of working hard for your place, it's a shame really that you don't have the ambition required to play here.
KEY-381251: You really look like you're lacking confidence, as a winger you should be looking to drive at your full back and get your crosses in, you've barely attempted any dribbles in your recent matches and you need to work on that to get back in the side.
KEY-381252: You should be working as hard as possible to get in that squad while you're here, we've got every chance of qualifying for continental football if you stick around and work hard to help us.
KEY-381254: You should be working as hard as possible to get in that squad while you're here. We've got every chance of qualifying for the [%comp#4-short] if you stick around and work hard to help us.
KEY-381256: You should be working as hard as possible to get in that squad while you're here. You've got every chance of being called up without having to leave.
KEY-381257: You should be working as hard as possible to help us qualify for continental football while you're here, you've got every chance of achieving your dreams without having to leave.
KEY-381258: You should be working as hard as possible to help us qualify for the [%comp#3] while you're here, you've got every chance of achieving your dreams without having to leave.
KEY-381259: You should have thought about that when signing your contract here then, I've got no intention of letting you go just so you can fulfil some personal goal, concentrate on the team, not yourself.
KEY-381260: You should have thought about that when signing your contract here then. I've got no intention of letting you go just so you can fulfil some personal goal, concentrate on the team rather than yourself.
KEY-381261: You should have thought about that when signing your contract here then. I've got no intention of letting you go just so you can fulfil some personal goal, concentrate on the team, not yourself.
KEY-381262: You should have thought about that when you signed your contract here. I'm not willing to put the personal preferences of an individual ahead of the team.
KEY-381263: You should stay here, I don't see any reason why we shouldn't have as good a working relationship as you think you'll have with [%person#4].
KEY-381266: You weren't winning enough tackles for my liking, you need to go away and work on winning your challenges to get back in the side.
KEY-381268: You're a striker and you're not scoring enough, it's as simple as that, your job is to get us goals and we've had a very poor return from you when you've played.
KEY-381273: You're being ridiculous, there isn't even a bid on the table and it's come to this? I'm not willing to discuss this any further until an offer comes in.
KEY-381274: You're being very unprofessional here and I don't even know why we're still discussing this, no bid has been made and I'm not going to sit here and waste any more time talking about it until an offer comes in.
KEY-381275: You're being very unprofessional here and I don't even know why we're still discussing this, nobody is currently interested in you and I'm not going to sit here and waste any more time talking about it until that changes.
KEY-381276: You're coming back from a lengthy spell on the sidelines and I think it's a bit soon for you to be getting regular football, keep working on your recovery and you'll be back in my plans.
KEY-381278: You're going to be playing a fair bit of reserve football in the coming weeks, if you can put in consistently good performances at that level then I'll be willing to give you a chance in the first-team.
KEY-381279: You're going to be playing a fair bit of reserve football in the coming weeks; if you can put in consistently good performances at that level then I'll be willing to give you a chance in the first-team.
KEY-381280: You're going to have to accept that I think it's too soon for you, if you can't accept that then I'll gladly move you on as I'm not going to have my players trying to dictate my team selection.
KEY-381281: You're going to have to forget about moving to [%team#3-short] I'm afraid as I'll be rejecting any approaches that come in for you regardless of who is making the bid.
KEY-381282: You're going to need to understand that circumstances change, I can't just give everybody what they want the whole time, be patient and you'll get your chance.
KEY-381283: You're just being beaten in the air too easily, as a defender we need to rely on you to win your aerial battles and you haven't been doing that, you need to improve your heading if you want to be back in the side.
KEY-381284: You're just not scoring enough for a midfielder these days, we need more goals and haven't had a good enough return from you; you need to address that to get back in the side.
KEY-381285: You're just too good at coming off the bench and influencing games, I can't risk losing your impact as a sub by starting you I'm afraid but you are an invaluable part of my squad here.
KEY-381286: You're leaving on a free, I'm not going to waste time playing someone who isn't going to be here much longer, you're just going to have to sit it out until you go I'm afraid.
KEY-381287: You're not going anywhere and that's final. You can make all the threats you want but I'm not going to have any of my players tell me how to manage my squad.
KEY-381288: You're not going anywhere so I'd suggest you forget about moving to [%team#3-short] and get on with your game. I'll be rejecting any bids that come in for you.
KEY-381290: You're not going to get your way here, I'm not going to cave in to player threats so you'd better just accept it and get on with your job like a professional.
KEY-381292: You're really going to have to toughen up if you want to succeed in this game, you're going nowhere. The sooner you realise that you can't always get your own way the better.
KEY-381294: You're right, I haven't given you a fair shot and really don't want to lose you. I'm prepared to offer you the security of being a contracted player if it helps keep you at the club.
KEY-381295: You're right, I haven't given you a fair shot and you do seem ready to me. You can expect to feature in the first-team in the next month or so.
KEY-381297: You're right, I think a loan move would be really good for you. I'll try to get one sorted as soon as possible and hopefully it will stand you in good stead for first-team football here when you return.
KEY-381298: You're right, I'm willing to give you another chance in the next few matches but I expect to see a clear improvement from you based on what I've told you today.
KEY-381299: You're right, that is a little beyond us at the minute. I'm not willing to lose you without a fight though; would a pay rise tempt you to stay?
KEY-381300: You're right, the side hasn't been in great form but I need to give the players a fair chance to turn it around before ringing the changes, be patient and you'll get your chance eventually.
KEY-381301: You're right, you haven't been playing enough and I'm going to rectify that. You can expect to find yourself in the starting line-up a lot more regularly in the next few weeks.
KEY-381302: You're totally right, I should have given you a chance by now, I'll rectify this straight away though as I don't want you to leave. You can expect to start the next few matches for sure.
KEY-381303: You're totally right, you've earned a chance and I apologise for not giving it to you sooner, you can expect to start the next few games though for sure.
KEY-381304: You're under contract at this club and I have no intention of letting you go, you're going to have to forget about a move and concentrate on your football.
KEY-381306: You've been a fantastic servant to the club and it would be unfair of me to stand in your way. I'll try to find a new club for you as soon as possible.
KEY-381307: You've been too sloppy in possession, as a modern defender you need to be able to use the ball well alongside your defensive duties, if you can address your distribution then I'll be willing to give you another chance.
KEY-381308: You've forced my hand a bit here, I've got no intention of selling you so I guess I'll have to give you the game time you're looking for.
KEY-381309: You've just been too greedy in recent matches, I know that as a striker this is hard to understand but it's not all about you, you need to use your team-mates more to stay in the side.
KEY-381311: You've left me with no option but to sell you in that case, I didn't want to lose you but you've made it clear nothing will keep you here.
KEY-381312: You've lost too many aerial battles to have stayed in the side, go away and work on your heading as we need our defenders to be dominant in the air at this level.
KEY-381314: You've seemed very unwilling to take your full back on in recent matches, you need to be attempting to beat the defender and get your crosses in. Work on your dribbling if you want to get back in the team.
KEY-381315: Your behaviour here is totally out of order, I'm not going to sit back and allow you to pollute the rest of my squad. You're going to be training with the kids for the foreseeable future.
KEY-381316: Your experience is invaluable; we need you around the place to be a positive influence on the rest of the squad, particularly the youngsters. I can't let you go.
KEY-381317: Your form for the reserves has been okay but I still think it could have been better, keep working hard and rest assured that I haven't forgotten about you.
KEY-381318: Your form has been decent enough but I'm still going to need to see more from you if you're going to earn a spot in the first-team, keep working hard, I haven't forgotten about you.
KEY-381319: Your performances dropped off too much from the bench, I don't want to sell you but you need to get yourself back in my plans with your performances not by complaining.
KEY-381320: Your stubbornness is going to cost you here, I was willing to let you go on my terms but I can just as easily keep you here if you're not going to cooperate with me.
KEY-381321: Your wages are obviously important to you so in order to keep you here. I'm willing to give you a new contract on similar terms to what [%team#3] offer would be.

KEY-382295: It would be nice to win it. It's important to be successful and vital for our players to experience those moments
KEY-382297: It's always nice to win these games - it gives the whole team a massive boost
KEY-382299: Last season [%team#1-short] were within touching distance of winning the [%comp#1-short], only to be cruelly denied. Surely it must be a fantastic feeling to have taken the team one step further this time around?

KEY-382326: Players signed from a MLS club's academy are categorised as Homegrown; they retain this status until they permanently move to a non-MLS club.

KEY-382342: Salary cap impact for Designated Player contract
KEY-382343: Selected player already picked
KEY-382346: Since the clause has been activated outside the transfer window, [%person#1-surname] will remain on loan at [%team#2-short] for the time being, but the future buy clauses have now been deactivated.
KEY-382347: Some of the lads feel you were wrong to dismiss [%male#3-first] concerns over the sale of [%male#4]; he was one of our brightest prospects and quite frankly it defied belief you would let him go.
KEY-382348: Some players will play here, others will play in another fixture. It's about using the squad in a balanced fashion

KEY-382418: We fancy our chances against some of the remaining teams, that's for sure
KEY-382419: We receive a large amount of media attention, and your media handling has been dubious to say the least, why is that the case?

KEY-382586: As far as I'm concerned it's all speculation anyway, the board have full confidence in me and that's all that matters
KEY-382592: Despite the result I was very impressed by his side's fighting spirit and I think the board at [%team#2] should give him more time now
KEY-382595: Due to finishing in last place, [%club#1-short] will start [%fixture_name#1-long] with [%number#1] points deducted.
KEY-382598: Enthusiastic [%male#2-surname] credits [%job#1] talk
KEY-382599: Export Current Custom [%string#1]
KEY-382601: Following [%scoreline#1-long], [%male#1] agent [%person#2] would like to open contract talks with the club as a result of his client's emergence as a first team squad player.
KEY-382607: If you think it's best for the team then we're all going to have to go along with it and hope for the best. Fingers crossed you're right.
KEY-382609: It was a gutless performance from [%person#2-surname] side, if that's all he can offer when he's fighting for his job then he deserves to lose it
KEY-382610: It was a while ago, but [%team#1-short] actually suffered defeat the last time they played [%team#2-short]. Will that have any bearing ahead of this game?
KEY-382611: It's a long season and rotation is necessary. [%male#2-first] is a very good player and he, like anyone else, will be subject to this sort of treatment at any given juncture of the season
KEY-382612: It's always nice to go back and get a victory at a previous team
KEY-382613: It's no secret that I'm under a lot of pressure here at the minute and I've got to admit I'm struggling to deal with it
KEY-382614: Last Place Finish
KEY-382615: Left drag to change position on the pitch
KEY-382619: Maybe you're right; perhaps we've been a bit harsh towards you here.
KEY-382625: Some players have disappointed me with their reaction
KEY-382629: The Quick Search allows you to set more specific conditions and search for players already scouted. It's most useful when you've built up a strong database of known players through scouting and club knowledge as you can then refine the information from a wider talent pool.

KEY-383299: Despite history showing that teams generally stay in the [%comp#1-short] with [%number#1] points, it looks like it may well take more than that this season. How does that affect things for [%team#1-short]?
KEY-383300: Despite history showing that teams generally stay in the [%comp#1-short] with [%number#1] points, it looks like it might not take that much this season. How does that affect things for [%team#1-short]?
KEY-383301: Despite the fact that we consider [%male#3] to be worth a Designated player contract, MLS do not believe the player has any interest in moving to the league. We therefore regret to inform you that your request is rejected.
KEY-383302: Despite the fact that we consider [%male#3] to be worth a Designated player contract, MLS has informed us they won't give any contribution to the player signing as they are not interested in bringing him to the league, we therefore regret to inform you that your request is rejected.
KEY-383303: Do you agree with those who say that the [%comp#1-short] wouldn't be the same without fixtures like this?
KEY-383304: Do you anticipate a positive reaction from your players to the likely fervent atmosphere created by fixtures like this one or will some of them find it tough going?
KEY-383314: Dribble Less
KEY-383315: Early Pre-Season
KEY-383325: First Game In Competitition For This Nation
KEY-383560: No real regrets here, no. I'd have liked it to have gone differently but I can't control fate
KEY-383561: No suitable Best Role for this position
KEY-383562: No suitable best roles for this position
KEY-383563: No, not at all. I've achieved a certain amount in this profession and accepting a job from lower down the ladder at this point in my career would effectively be rendering that irrelevant
KEY-383564: No, not at all. I've achieved a certain amount in this profession and accepting a job from lower down the ladder would effectively be rendering that irrelevant
KEY-383565: No, that's not for me any more. I've tried it and took the good with the bad but, on balance, I'd rather stick to a more comfortable role in [%nation#1]
KEY-383566: No, that's not for me at all. I'd not be able to adapt to the lifestyle and the different footballing philosophy of another country
KEY-383567: No. There was interest at one stage but we're no longer after him
KEY-383571: Not Drafted - Designated player
KEY-383572: Not Drafted - Young Designated Player
KEY-383575: Not if we have anything to do with it! We're a more realistic challenger than they are in my book
KEY-383576: Not necessarily, I just don't want to go into too much detail at this moment in time
KEY-383577: Not necessarily; management is a completely new challenge for me and I can't just presume that I'll succeed because of my playing career
KEY-383579: Not until they're mathematical certainties to survive. Football's a funny old game...
KEY-383602: Player Type
KEY-383604: Players are always allowed to play for their parent club's reserve team
KEY-383605: Players are never allowed to play for their parent club's reserve team
KEY-383606: Players are often allowed to play for their parent club's reserve team
KEY-383607: Players are rarely allowed to play for their parent club's reserve team
KEY-383608: Playing and coaching there is an honour and one to tick off the bucket list, so to speak
KEY-383609: Pot. Cap Impact
KEY-383610: Preferable
KEY-383613: Probably nothing, thinking about it. I'm looking forward to new challenges already
KEY-383617: RDS
KEY-383621: Recent speculation suggests that [%team#2-short] may be interested in signing [%male#2], with talk they may trigger his [%cash#1] release fee. Are you at all concerned about this?
KEY-383622: Registered players that pick up a long-term injury can be replaced in the squad up until the [%number#1-nth] match
KEY-383626: Salary Cap Hit
KEY-383628: Season Overlaps Years

KEY-383659: Surely the rules were clear though, and given they're unlikely to be changed, will you be making plans to deal with this sort of situation better in the future?
KEY-383661: Teams are beginning to circle around [%male#2] amidst transfer speculation suggesting they may be interested in triggering his [%cash#1] release fee. Are you at all concerned about that?
KEY-383667: That result moves [%team#1-short] into a continental qualification spot. You must be pleased with that so late in the season?
KEY-383668: That result moves [%team#1-short] into a continental qualification spot. You must be pleased with that?
KEY-383669: That result moves [%team#1-short] into the playoff places. How confident are you of making a real challenge for promotion now?
KEY-383670: That result moves [%team#1-short] into the playoff places. You must be pleased with that?
KEY-383671: That result moves [%team#1-short] out of the relegation zone, a huge boost at this stage of the season. How confident are you of staying up?
KEY-383672: That result sees [%team#1-short] climb out of the relegation zone. That must give you plenty of reasons to be positive?
KEY-383673: That result sees [%team#1-short] drop into the relegation zone. You must be disappointed with that rather dubious honour?
KEY-383674: That result sees [%team#1-short] drop into the relegation zone; surely an ominous sign at this late stage of the season?
KEY-383675: That result sees [%team#1-short] drop off the top of the league. You must be somewhat disappointed with that?
KEY-383676: That result sees [%team#1-short] drop off the top of the league; surely a devastating blow at this stage of the season?
KEY-383677: That result sees [%team#1-short] drop out of the [%continent#1-continentality] football qualifying places. You must be rather disappointed with that?
KEY-383678: That result sees [%team#1-short] drop out of the playoff places. You must be rather disappointed with that?
KEY-383679: That result sees [%team#1-short] fall out of the [%continent#1-continentality] football qualifying places; surely a bitter blow to take at this stage of the season?
KEY-383680: That result sees [%team#1-short] fall out of the promotion playoff picture; surely a bitter blow to take at this stage of the season?
KEY-383681: That result sees [%team#1-short] shoot right up the table. You've got to be happy with that?
KEY-383682: That result takes [%team#1-short] top of the league. You must be pleased with that so late in the season?
KEY-383684: That sounds about right. It's always going to be the initial target and typically it's proven sufficient to mean relegation won't happen
KEY-383691: That would suggest he doesn't have a future at the club, wouldn't you agree?
KEY-383692: That would suggest that they do not have a future at the club, wouldn't you agree?
KEY-383698: That's something we won't know for sure until it's tested out really. I'd like to think we've got plenty going for us but footballers - and their agents - can be funny people
KEY-383701: The [%club#2] board have also announced that the stadium will be renamed [%stadium#2], after one of [%club#1-short-nickname] heroes.

KEY-383715: The [%club#2] board have today announced that the club have been granted planning permission to build a new stadium. [BRK_LN] Construction of [%stadium#2] will cost around [%cash#1-roundlarge], although this figure will be offset by the [%cash#2-roundlarge] the club will receive by selling [%stadium#1].

KEY-383723: The [%club#2] board have today announced that the club have completed negotiations to purchase [%string#1] and relocate the club to the recently built stadium. [BRK_LN] The purchase of the local stadium will cost around [%cash#1-roundlarge], although this figure will be offset by the [%cash#2-roundlarge] the club will receive by selling [%stadium#1].
KEY-383724: The [%club#2] board have today announced that the club have completed negotiations to purchase [%string#1] and relocate the club to the recently built stadium. [BRK_LN] The purchase of the local stadium will cost around [%cash#1-roundlarge].
KEY-383727: The [%comp#2-short] is a fine league but so are many others. This just happens to be our year
KEY-383733: The build-up to the match doesn't help in the slightest. There are far too many distractions creating additional pressure and the players may struggle to handle that
KEY-383734: The chairman explained that this is a club looking to go places and I firmly believe in the project here
KEY-383735: The chairman has a responsibility to do what's right for the club and in this case I'm probably not in a position to argue that they were wrong
KEY-383736: The club absolutely must bring somebody else in as soon as possible, it's a role of huge importance and I'll certainly be contacting a couple of people with a view to bringing them in
KEY-383737: The club absolutely must bring somebody else in as soon as possible, it's a role of huge importance and I'll certainly be making a couple of recommendations
KEY-383738: The club won't stand in the way of anybody wishing to leave and the circumstances are such that we have to do what's right here
KEY-383739: The concerns are there and clear for all to see and it's up to us to make sure we don't fall into that trap
KEY-383741: The evidence certainly points towards that, doesn't it? It'll be a great final to watch and I'm really looking forward to it
KEY-383742: The final of the competition is, of course, to be played at [%stadium#1]. How big of an incentive is it to potentially play at home if you get that far?
KEY-383743: The finish line is in clear sight and we have to make sure we're sprinting towards it rather than slacking off. Every match matters now
KEY-383745: The lads know how they need to respond. They mustn't rest on their laurels; it takes one slip-up for things to suddenly go very badly wrong
KEY-383746: The magical [%number#1]-point target to avoid relegation looks be slipping away from your team as we reach the season's final weeks. Are you confident of pulling off a great escape?
KEY-383747: The magical [%number#1]-point target to avoid relegation looks to be very much within reach now. Are you confident of avoiding relegation?
KEY-383748: The players deserve all the credit in the world. They've made this happen and this should be their moment
KEY-383749: The players deserve all the credit, hopefully we can go on and make good on our position now
KEY-383750: The players know how important it is for the fans to go home with bragging rights and don't want to let them down, but they can't lose focus from their main task
KEY-383751: The quality of your club's training facilities is also displayed here; the better your training facilities are, the more effective your team's training will be.
KEY-383782: They'll be better with a new manager in charge; [%person#2-surname] was out of his depth and would've been canned at some point for sure
KEY-383784: They're typically must-watch occasions and I'm proud to be involved in them
KEY-383785: They've been reminded of their professional requirements, that's all I have to say
KEY-383786: They've done well to get this far but I'm not especially convinced about any of them
KEY-383787: Things did not get off to a good start for [%team#2-short] as [%male#1-surname] scored from the spot after [%male#2] had conceded a penalty through handling the ball.
KEY-383788: Things did not get off to a good start for [%team#2-short] as [%male#1-surname] scored from the spot after [%male#2] had given away a penalty following a push inside the area.
KEY-383789: Things did not get off to a good start for [%team#2-short] as [%male#1-surname] scored from the spot after [%male#2] had given away a penalty following a trip in the box.
KEY-383790: Things did not get off to a good start for [%team#2-short] as [%male#1-surname] scored from the spot after [%male#2] had given away a penalty following a two-footed lunge.
KEY-383791: Things did not get off to a good start for [%team#2-short] as [%male#1-surname] scored from the spot after [%male#2] had given away a penalty following an alleged elbow.

KEY-383794: Things did not get off to a good start for [%team#2-short] as [%male#1-surname] scored from the spot after [%male#2] had given away a penalty for obstruction.
KEY-383795: Things wouldn't be quite the same if we didn't have games like this to look forward to
KEY-383796: This is going to be a new experience for me and it's only natural that there will be a transitional period
KEY-383797: This is what happens when you don't take your chances. They hardly had a kick but they were more clinical when it counted so fair play to them
KEY-383802: Tick to force the sidebar to display only icons and no text, even if you increase the window width.
KEY-383803: Tinkerer comes unstuck
KEY-383807: To be honest I try not to think of all the stuff surrounding the match, it's just another fixture at the end of the day
KEY-383808: Today was just one of those days. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred we'd have won that comfortably but [%team#2-short] have instead been very lucky here
KEY-383809: Tomorrow's match sees you square off against [%person#2] for the first time since a very public disagreement following your sacking by [%team#3-short]. Are you looking forward to it?
KEY-383821: Unfortunately that's the state of the modern game; money is a massive part of things nowadays and that can sometimes cause things to go wrong
KEY-383824: Unusually, you take your first football management job at the age of [%number#1]. Why has it taken so long and what would you say to those who think you might be out of touch with the modern game?
KEY-383834: Was it a hard decision to let a bright prospect like [%male#3] depart or was it the only way you could clinch the signing of [%male#2]?
KEY-383835: Was there anything in particular that attracted you to accepting [%male#2] in exchange for [%male#3] and are you pleased to have him here?
KEY-383836: We are working hard to win and that will be the case regardless of the importance of the fixture
KEY-383837: We aren't convinced that our fan base is that big and it would be an irresponsible risk to expand the stadium if we won't fill it. Therefore, we reject the request.
KEY-383838: We believe people are wise enough to attribute the pitch condition to the recent poor weather. We therefore reject your request.
KEY-383839: We believe that finding a new affiliate is a fair request in order for the club to move forward. Is there anything else you would like to request?
KEY-383840: We believe that finding a new affiliate is a fair request in order for the club's vision to be met. Is there anything else you would like to request?
KEY-383841: We can't rule anything out until the maths say we're safe
KEY-383844: We deserved to stay up. We worked harder and played better than other teams, there was no luck involved
KEY-383845: We feel the current level of rent we are paying is fair and a far more practical arrangement than buying a stadium we simply cannot afford right now.
KEY-383846: We hardly have a choice do we? If the rules remain as they are then we'll have to abide by them even if they're farcical
KEY-383847: We have a great league full of fantastic players and astute managers. Everyone associated should be proud
KEY-383848: We have to adapt to whatever's thrown at us and I expect my players to meet the standards expected of them
KEY-383850: We haven't thrown in the towel yet; it's not an ideal result but we're still very much in with a chance of staying up
KEY-383851: We just needed numbers at the end of the day. Him retiring would have meant spending more on transfer fees and salaries in order to replace him so this suits everybody better
KEY-383852: We know these matches can often result in unsavoury scenes and controversial incidents. Do you believe your players can handle that?
KEY-383853: We never have to worry about things like that when the fans are as up for it as they typically are for these matches
KEY-383855: We thrashed out a few things during a lengthy negotiation process and ultimately I think we've come out of it with a good deal
KEY-383857: We will do whatever it takes to win. Don't give me any of that nonsense about winning the 'right' way, winning is all that really matters at the end of the day
KEY-383858: We won't take many special measures for this match. A stable defence combined with intelligent use of possession are fundamental to any victory
KEY-383860: We'll do whatever it takes to win and if that rubs people up the wrong way it's their problem
KEY-383861: We'll focus on the match in front of us each time and hopefully it'll be enough to take us through
KEY-383862: We'll have to wait and see how they deal with it; it wasn't a pleasant experience for any of us and often those types of results can see confidence absolutely plummet
KEY-383863: We'll have to wait and see how they deal with it; it wasn't a pleasant experience for any of us and often times those types of results can see confidence absolutely plummet
KEY-383866: We'll see what he's got to say after we're done with his team. I have a feeling he'll be eating his words
KEY-383867: We'll sit down very soon and work out how we expect things to run on a day-to-day basis. I'm sure we'll find a solution that fits everyone
KEY-383872: We're already looking forward to the next match; we can't afford to dwell on this result
KEY-383873: We're both coming off a little childish here and I'd like to move on from it if at all possible
KEY-383874: We're definitely going to be weaker for it; the timing is far from ideal
KEY-383875: We're focused solely on ourselves and haven't given a second thought to how others in [%nation#1-short] feel about it
KEY-383876: We're going to find some time to sit down and discuss an improved deal for a player who thoroughly deserves it. We'd hate to lose him for a fee close to his clause, that almost goes without saying
KEY-383877: We're looking at a lot of players and I certainly won't be giving anything more than that away
KEY-383878: We're looking to sign one more player and [%male#2-first] is one of the possibilities. We're not focused solely on him though
KEY-383879: We're trying to figure that out ourselves right now so until we've gotten to the bottom of it I can't comment
KEY-383881: We're willing to accept your proposal to find a new affiliate as part of the club's vision. Is there anything else you would like to request?
KEY-383882: We've got a lot of improving to do if we as a nation want to produce a club capable of winning in continental competitions
KEY-383883: We've got every reason to believe we can get back up the table. I'm really looking forward to working hard for the rest of the season in an effort to do just that
KEY-383884: We've got every reason to believe we can get back up there. I'm really looking forward to working hard for the rest of the season in an effort to do just that
KEY-383885: We've got one of the best leagues in the world right now and I'm pleased we've been joined at this stage by other [%nation#1-nationality] teams
KEY-383886: We've had a stroke of good fortune in being paired against an inferior opponent. It gives us the opportunity to rotate the squad and to perhaps see how some of our younger players get on
KEY-383887: We've just settled into our deserved position now we've caught up on the fixture list. It doesn't mean a great deal in terms of how much more we can do between now and the final whistle this season
KEY-383888: We've played [%team#2-short] a lot down the years and it's almost always meant something. How can that not be great to experience?
KEY-383889: We've put that disappointment behind us and we're now fully focused on responding in the right manner
KEY-383890: We've seen it happen before; everyone ups their game when the stakes are raised and surprise results come every single week. We can't afford to think we're safe before we mathematically are
KEY-383891: We've spent some time working on ensuring that we react in the right way but you never really know until you're out there
KEY-383892: We've spoken about the importance of remaining 100% focused and I trust them to get the job done
KEY-383897: Were you surprised by [%team#2-short] decision to sack [%person#2] this week?
KEY-383902: What are your thoughts about rivalries against teams like [%team#2-short], where they've been born in a competitive environment rather than as the result of geography?
KEY-383903: What are your thoughts about rivalries against teams like [%team#2-short], where they've lasted a considerable time and been passed down generations of fans?
KEY-383904: What are your thoughts on playing [%team#2-short] in the [%comp#1-short]?
KEY-383905: What are your thoughts on playing a team the size and stature of [%team#2-short] in the [%comp#1-short]?
KEY-383906: What do you make of rivalries against teams like [%team#2-short], where they've been established over a number of years and stood the test of time?
KEY-383907: What do you make of rivalries against teams like [%team#2-short], where they've been established primarily as a result of on-field competition?
KEY-383917: Whilst their [%position#2-general] depth could have left other managers unsure of their best team selection, [%team#1-short] have used that strength to put together a fine run of form, and now the likes of [%person_list#2] must wonder if they are ever going to be able to get into the team.
KEY-383938: You need a bit of needle in matches like this but we have to ensure it's done in the right way and not allowed to boil over into something none of us want to see
KEY-383940: You win some and you lose some; on the balance of things I have no arguments
KEY-383941: You won't find me talking about a player at another club until a deal is done. I'm sure our fans can appreciate that
KEY-383946: [%club#1-short] options in the [%position#1-lowercase] department have become even more limited with news of [%position#1-lowercase] [%male#1] suffering [%injury#1], and the team now have some important short-term decisions to make.
KEY-383947: [%date#1-day] match sees you go up against [%team#2-short] newly-appointed manager, [%person#2]. Ahead of the match, how do you feel about your chances going up against a relatively inexperienced newcomer?
KEY-383948: [%date#1-day] match sees you go up against [%team#2-short] newly-appointed manager, [%person#2]. Ahead of the match, how do you feel about your chances going up against an extremely experienced competitor?
KEY-384015: [%male#2-first] had a lot of experience but I think it's safe to say we've got plenty of talented players here who are more than capable of doing well without him
KEY-384016: [%male#2-first] is a terrific player and I insisted he was a part of this deal
KEY-384018: [%male#2-surname] rumours have no substance says [%person#1-surname]
KEY-384019: [%male#2-surname] rumours have no substance says [%person#1-surname]
KEY-384020: [%male#2-surname] then gave away another penalty for [%team#1-short] after a spot of shirt pulling, allowing [%male#1-surname] to do the necessary from the spot.
KEY-384021: [%male#2-surname] then gave away another penalty for [%team#1-short] after an apparent obstruction, with [%male#1-surname] doing the honours from the spot.
KEY-384022: [%male#2-surname] then gave away another penalty for [%team#1-short] after appearing to push his opponent in the box, with [%male#1-surname] doing the honours from the spot.
KEY-384023: [%male#2-surname] then gave away another penalty for [%team#1-short] after being penalised for a high foot inside the area, with [%male#1-surname] doing the honours from the spot.
KEY-384024: [%male#2-surname] then gave away another penalty for [%team#1-short] after handling the ball in the box, with [%male#1-surname] doing the honours from the spot.
KEY-384025: [%male#2-surname] then gave away another penalty for [%team#1-short] after tripping his man in the box, with [%male#1-surname] doing the honours from the spot.
KEY-384026: [%male#2-surname] then gave away another penalty for [%team#1-short] for a two-footed tackle inside the area, with [%male#1-surname] doing the honours from the spot.
KEY-384027: [%male#2-surname] then gave away another penalty for [%team#1-short] for an alleged elbow, with [%male#1-surname] doing the honours from the spot.
KEY-384028: [%male#2] doesn't feature in your team today, what's the thinking behind that?
KEY-384029: [%male#2] has been in scintillating form this season and has [%number#1] assists to his name. How important has his contribution been to your team?
KEY-384030: [%male#2] has been one of [%team#2-short] best players this season. Where would they be without him in your opinion?
KEY-384031: [%male#2] has of course announced his decision to retire at the end of the season. Do you think it's the right decision?
KEY-384032: [%male#2] has performed a sensational U-turn and has shelved plans for retirement. How pleased are you that he's staying on?
KEY-384033: [%male#2] is ruled out of the [%fixture_name#1] due to suspension. Just how much of a disappointment is that?
KEY-384034: [%male#2] returned to [%nation#1-nationality] football today after a spell abroad. How pleased were you to see him back?
KEY-384037: [%male#2] market value has reached the point where it may now exceed his reported [%cash#1] release fee. Will you be looking to address that in order to keep one of your most important assets?
KEY-384038: [%male#2] new contract reportedly contains a release clause set at [%cash#1], a figure higher than the previously estimated [%cash#2]. Are you pleased at presumably being able to strengthen the club's position here?
KEY-384039: [%male#2] new contract reportedly contains a release clause set at [%cash#1], a reduction on the previously estimated [%cash#2]. Are you at all concerned about that?
KEY-384040: [%male#2] new contract reportedly contains a release clause set at [%cash#1]. Are you comfortable with that?
KEY-384044: [%male#3] had a disallowed goal for your team today that arguably should have stood. Was it wrongly ruled out?
KEY-384045: [%male#3] is reportedly a transfer target for [%team#2]. Do you fear the club's well-publicised financial problems mean he's unlikely to stay?
KEY-384046: [%nation#1-nationality] football isn't the biggest but we've got some really strong teams and could quite conceivably cause an upset or two
KEY-384062: I am pleased yes, it's nice for the lads and it's a reward for the way in which they go about their business. It's up to them to keep going now
KEY-384063: I am pleased yes, it's nice for the lads and it's a reward for the way in which they go about their business. It's up to them to keep going now
KEY-384064: I am pleased yes, it's nice for the lads to not have to deal with the stress of being associated with a relegation struggle regardless of the stage of the season we're at
KEY-384065: I am pleased yes, it's nice to keep on moving in a positive direction and hopefully we can maintain it
KEY-384066: I appreciate I'm probably in the minority here but it doesn't mean very much to me
KEY-384068: I became frustrated by the whole experience on and off the pitch. I wasn't in a position to work to my capacities
KEY-384069: I believe in my players. We're not out of this yet and there's plenty of fight left in everyone here I can assure you
KEY-384070: I believe it will. I've been preparing for management for a number of years now and I'm delighted to be starting my career at [%team#1-short]
KEY-384072: I can see why some people would be dubious of my credentials but the only way I can prove them wrong is with time
KEY-384073: I can't and won't go into too many details but there were a lot of awkward moments between myself and those higher up in the club. It was never likely to end well for me there
KEY-384074: I can't claim very much credit for it; they were determined to go out and take advantage to give themselves the best chance of succeeding
KEY-384075: I can't claim very much credit for it; with so much at stake everyone was already raring to go to get the job done
KEY-384076: I can't deny it wouldn't add something to the occasion but we just want to go as far as we can and see what happens
KEY-384077: I can't deny that some players don't handle pressure well but it's up to the others to hopefully pick up the slack and help out
KEY-384078: I can't envisage a scenario in which [%nation#1-nationality] team has the resources to overcome a more powerful opponent in a big match
KEY-384079: I can't go into detail in public about how we intend to handle this situation
KEY-384080: I can't go into too much detail but if there are interested parties out there, we'll be waiting to hear from them
KEY-384083: I can't say I know how the player himself feels but we'll have to see what happens. At the very least we'd like to increase the release value but contract negotiations can be tough sledding the majority of the time so I can't promise the supporters anything
KEY-384085: I can't say that I do. You take the good with the bad and move on knowing you'll try to do better next time
KEY-384086: I can't say that I have strong feelings either way
KEY-384087: I can't wait for it, I'm just like the supporters in that regard
KEY-384088: I can't wait to get back into the swing of things. I'm already looking at a few potential situations of interest
KEY-384089: I can't wait, it'll be a fantastic occasion and hopefully we can get off to a great start
KEY-384091: I certainly hope it'll be enough; we'll just have to do our best to accumulate as many points as possible and see what happens
KEY-384092: I completely disagreed with the decision and feel extremely wronged, but what can I do about it now? The manager is always the one to bite the bullet
KEY-384093: I completely understand the strength of local feeling for those types of rivalries but locking horns with teams in a competitive manner over a number of years is intense and often memorable
KEY-384094: I completely understand the strength of local feeling for those types of rivalries but locking horns with teams over a great many years is intense and often memorable
KEY-384095: I constantly remind the players to do their jobs. As long as they take care of their responsibilities we should be fine
KEY-384096: I could have done with more time to prepare but I expect every manager up and down the country wants the same!
KEY-384097: I could have selected him had I wanted but it's important to consider the bigger picture as well
KEY-384098: I couldn't be happier to have him as a part of the team. It's important to have that sort of connection with the fans and the team and it should always be factored in as we develop for the future
KEY-384100: I couldn't have hoped for a better way to get started. A win against them immediately gets the fans on board and gives us real momentum to build on
KEY-384101: I couldn't have hoped for a better way to get started. A win immediately gets the fans on board and gives us real momentum to build on
KEY-384102: I couldn't have hoped for a better way to get started. We can lay down a marker against one of the best teams we'll face and get a great feel for where we stand as a team
KEY-384103: I did ask him to reconsider, yes. He might not be the same player he once was but his experience can still be extremely useful
KEY-384104: I did it because I didn't feel the team was playing well at that point and if [%male#2-first] feels hard done by he needs to look at the badge on his shirt and remember that this is a team game
KEY-384105: I did try to talk him out of it, who wouldn't? He's still a fantastic player after all. I'm not angry though, it's his career and he makes his own decisions
KEY-384106: I didn't particularly care which club it was, I was just desperate to get into management to be honest with you
KEY-384107: I didn't want to do it because I knew it would create a story but it had to be done to help the team as much as possible at that point in the game
KEY-384108: I don't expect anything like that to happen to us but it does rely on the players doing the job expected of them
KEY-384109: I don't feel able to speak freely. If I do, I'm punished for it
KEY-384110: I don't have any considerable worries on this front but I'll offer a gentle reminder just before kick-off nonetheless
KEY-384113: I don't intend to make a long-term issue of it but I stand firmly by my original comments
KEY-384114: I don't know about that, it's going to take some effort and more than a bit of good fortune to avoid a struggle
KEY-384116: I don't know what to expect; if a suitable offer arrives there's not much we can do about it other than to fight our corner with [%male#2-first] as best we can
KEY-384117: I don't know what to make of it right now; it won't become clear until much closer to the end of the season
KEY-384118: I don't know what to make of the table right now, only to say that I think it could be a frustratingly inconsistent year for us
KEY-384119: I don't like it, it feels very uncomfortable and I don't really know what to do with myself
KEY-384123: I don't tend to feel the pressure, although that's not to say I don't appreciate what's at stake
KEY-384124: I don't tend to pay attention to what anyone else has to say, it's all a big circus anyway right?
KEY-384125: I don't think I handled things as well as I might have from a tactical point of view but that's a lesson to be learned and I'm sure these experiences will strengthen me as a person and as a manager
KEY-384126: I don't think age is important. The best way to earn the respect of the players is by winning games and I'm confident I can do that
KEY-384127: I don't think anything unusual happened, we just didn't get the results we needed and that will always bring problems. I'll always back my abilities as a manager though and can only hope for better luck in my next job
KEY-384128: I don't think he's very far off, we're stepping up his involvement and he should be good to go sooner rather than later
KEY-384129: I don't think it matters a great deal right now. We're focusing on each game as it comes, and we'll see where that leaves us later in the season
KEY-384130: I don't think it matters very much what I wear or what connotations that may have. If the results arrive then I can wear whatever I like
KEY-384131: I don't think it matters very much where they come from as long as they do their job
KEY-384132: I don't think our league is that strong; everyone else has just had a bad season
KEY-384133: I don't think we even need to talk about it
KEY-384134: I don't think we should over-react. There are some brilliant clubs in this country and I'm proud to work here
KEY-384135: I don't view it as anything other than the next match on our fixture list. We all have to play each other eventually
KEY-384137: I don't want to be judged on signing players who happen to have the same nationality as this club though, it seems too restrictive.
KEY-384139: I don't want to come across as someone who easily attributes blame to others but at the end of the day the manager can only do so much; the players have to go out there and perform and, if they're honest with you, a few of them didn't quite measure up
KEY-384140: I don't want to drag this one out any further but he was wrong and continues to be so to this very moment
KEY-384141: I don't want to dwell on that; it's best left in the past where it belongs
KEY-384142: I expect them to do well and be a threat later in the competition
KEY-384143: I expect there'll be a little bit of juggling in terms of personnel
KEY-384144: I expect we'll be tested on that front before much longer if he keeps this form up and, thought it saddens me to admit it, I don't think his long-term future is here
KEY-384145: I expected that sort of reaction considering his antics on the touchline at the time. We were better and he can't handle that
KEY-384146: I feel it's disingenuous to the other teams in the group to focus on one opponent. It's a very challenging set of fixtures for everybody
KEY-384147: I feel we deserved to survive. We were definitely good enough to, but the breaks didn't go our way
KEY-384148: I felt I couldn't take them any further and attempting to do so would've only made things worse
KEY-384149: I felt my comments were misconstrued at the time and we've cleared the air enough that it's no longer an issue as far as I'm concerned
KEY-384151: I felt we could've played a lot better today, especially with what was at stake
KEY-384152: I find it all a little tiresome but that might be because I have to sit here talking about it rather than focusing on preparing
KEY-384153: I find the rewards are more tangible when it comes to going up against the same teams time and again with huge stakes in play
KEY-384154: I find the rewards are more tangible when you hold the bragging rights against an eternal foe
KEY-384155: I fully expect to get back into the game eventually but right now I have a bit of free time and will consider using that as constructively as possible
KEY-384156: I get to work with a very well-rounded group of players; in situations like this I get them ready and they go out to get it done
KEY-384157: I guess that'll be right. It's not the biggest thing in the world but you've got to feel comfortable in your attire, right?
KEY-384158: I had a chuckle and then moved on; I've got more important things to deal with
KEY-384159: I hate not winning so this won't sit well; the events barely matter when it comes to that
KEY-384160: I have my thoughts on the matter and one day everybody might find out the truth when I write my book, but the time isn't right for that now
KEY-384161: I have complete faith in my players to get the job done whatever it takes
KEY-384162: I have complete faith in my players to get the job done, whatever it takes
KEY-384163: I have complete faith in him to do a job for the team and to play to the standards we expect of our players
KEY-384164: I have no concerns whatsoever. It might allow a club to have a bid accepted but, with due respect, [%male#2-first] has everything he could possibly want here and I think he's got a great future for us
KEY-384165: I have no concerns whatsoever. It might entice one or two clubs to test the water but, with due respect, [%male#2-first] has everything he could possibly want here and I think he's got a great future for us
KEY-384166: I have no say in the matter really; if the administrators want to cash in then they will
KEY-384167: I have nothing but respect for [%person#2-first] but it was undeniably complicated whilst he was here. Hopefully things become much easier now he's gone
KEY-384168: I have nothing but respect for [%person#2-first] but this has happened and we have to look at things positively
KEY-384169: I have plenty of respect for them but we fancy our chances and you'll see that in our intentions from the very first minute
KEY-384173: I hope it'll all be taken care of quite quickly and we can move on from talking about it
KEY-384174: I imagine it's rather unlikely given everything that's gone on
KEY-384175: I just don't think he had his heart set on joining us so we'll just have to move on
KEY-384176: I just hope it doesn't serve as a distraction to my players. We have to focus on playing our own game
KEY-384177: I knew before bringing him in that it would take some time before he was up to speed and that hasn't changed. We're prepared to be patient
KEY-384178: I know I could've done a lot better than I ultimately did. I have no qualms with their decision
KEY-384179: I learn something every day of my life and that's especially true in management. I'll take the positives and the negatives and use them both to become better at my job
KEY-384180: I left him out by choice. I have my reasons and they will become quite clear but I feel we're better off without him in the squad at this point in time
KEY-384181: I left them out by choice. I have my reasons and they will become quite clear but I feel we're better off without them in the squad at this point in time
KEY-384183: I like to play in an attacking manner when possible and that won't change here
KEY-384186: I like what I've seen of him so far and that bodes well for [%team#2-short] really
KEY-384187: I may have played to a high standard but I can't just expect to land a top job straight away. I have to earn my managerial corn at an appropriate level
KEY-384188: I might be new here but the players aren't; they know how to play and we'll save the bigger changes for another time
KEY-384189: I never doubted them to come out of the match with a result; they work harder than anyone else and they get what they deserve
KEY-384190: I only look at the table when every match has been played. Wherever we end up at that point is where we'll deserve to finish
KEY-384192: I prefer to be optimistic in times like these; it's a shame what's happened but it's a fantastic opportunity for others to come in and perhaps steal the headlines for themselves
KEY-384193: I prefer to be optimistic in times like these; it's a shame what's happened but it's a fantastic opportunity for someone else to come in and perhaps steal the headlines for themselves
KEY-384194: I prefer to deal with managing my team and let this sort of thing be decided by the supporters
KEY-384195: I prefer to have people doing their job to a high standard. It doesn't matter where they come from or what their experience is
KEY-384196: I prefer to talk about the way he plays as part of the team than discuss individual accolades. Nobody comes before the team
KEY-384197: I rate our chances highly. We know we're likely to be involved in the discussion but we've got the players to make a real go of staying up
KEY-384198: I really do appreciate it; it's not been easy of late and every positive sentiment helps right now
KEY-384202: I really wish things had worked out better than they eventually did. It'd be churlish to pretend otherwise
KEY-384203: I reckon there's a good five or six teams you could label as favourites but I'm not certain they're amongst them
KEY-384204: I reckon we're going to see teams go down with a record points tally. There's far too much quality in the league for that not to happen
KEY-384206: I refuse to be anything other than optimistic. We have to believe we're good enough to stay up else it's pointless even trying
KEY-384207: I repeat, I don't have the first clue
KEY-384208: I see no reason to worry right now. [%male#2-first] is under contract and has displayed absolutely no sign of wanting to be anywhere else
KEY-384209: I shouldn't think it'd come to that, no
KEY-384210: I stand by the view that he deserved to be sacked and I'm sure we'll show why here; he's just not a very good manager
KEY-384211: I still believe he was wrong but I can't spend my career trying to convince him of that so it's time we moved on
KEY-384212: I still firmly believe we can become champions; this just reduces our margin for error going forward
KEY-384213: I still firmly believe we can do this; this just reduces our margin for error going forward
KEY-384214: I tend to let the fans decide what matters in terms of rivalries. They were here before me and they'll be here long after I've gone
KEY-384215: I think he knows a good team when he sees one given his experience and so I'd have expected better from him really
KEY-384216: I think he's a terrific hire for them and I'm expecting a very tough time on [%date#1-day]
KEY-384217: I think he's kidding [%person#2-himself] if he thinks he's changed my mind; I still think he was rightly sacked and isn't all that good of a manager
KEY-384219: I think he's learned a few lessons here today and it's going to take some time until they're in our class
KEY-384220: I think anyone who comes out of a relegation battle with a smile on their face can count themselves lucky to some degree; it's needed to get over the line
KEY-384221: I think everyone did admirably considering the circumstances but [%male#2-first] deserves a special mention for sure
KEY-384222: I think he's a top quality player and he knows what we expect of him here going forward
KEY-384223: I think he's been extremely premature in announcing his retirement but it's not my problem any more
KEY-384225: I think it probably is, yes. He's been a terrific player but time catches up with everybody; if he feels it's time then it's time
KEY-384226: I think it says we've got the best league in the world, no question about it
KEY-384227: I think it's a freak event and not something we should dwell on if, as it did today, it goes against us
KEY-384228: I think it's been well-documented that we're after him and I'm convinced we can get a deal done
KEY-384229: I think it's challenging in places but that's why we're all here. We want to test ourselves against top quality opposition
KEY-384230: I think it's clear that they came with a game plan to park the bus and somehow it's worked for them. I know which style of football I'd prefer to play though
KEY-384231: I think it's disrespectful to discuss players who have contracts at other clubs
KEY-384232: I think it's far too early to be able to say for sure. We don't know how things will go
KEY-384233: I think it's going to be extremely hard. We're trying our best and that's all I can ask, but it might simply not be enough when all is said and done
KEY-384234: I think it's going to be incredibly hard. We're not kidding ourselves, it looks bleak right now
KEY-384235: I think it's important to ensure dominance in your own region before taking on bigger challenges
KEY-384236: I think it's impossible to think otherwise. They're a great team and a candidate to go very far
KEY-384237: I think it's too soon to have an answer for that question. I need some time to reflect
KEY-384238: I think it's unbelievable, we've been robbed by continually sub-standard officiating
KEY-384239: I think one of them was a clear goal but, let me be clear, the officials did a good job overall here
KEY-384240: I think so yes, it just makes me feel more comfortable if I get as close as possible to the action
KEY-384241: I think so yes. I believe we have a responsibility to act professionally at all times and that includes the manner in which we dress in public
KEY-384242: I think so yes; we've all worked extremely hard so far and whilst we won't rest on our laurels, it's looking good
KEY-384243: I think that might be the most ridiculous question I've ever heard. On what level could it possibly matter?!
KEY-384244: I think the rule is ridiculous and should be looked at by the governing bodies. It's farcical that we've had to do this
KEY-384245: I think their draw is tougher than it looks and they could well be in for a tough time of things
KEY-384246: I think they'd be even worse off without him
KEY-384247: I think they're one of the weaker teams in that group and they could struggle to make it out of it
KEY-384248: I think they've done enough to be alright now
KEY-384249: I think we'll be alright but we're certainly not going to take our foot off the gas just yet
KEY-384250: I think we're in with a great chance of progressing and that's all we could ask for
KEY-384251: I think we've done well so far and have no reason to think we can't get stronger as we approach the business end of the season
KEY-384252: I think we've got enough going for us here to keep our best players regardless of interest from elsewhere
KEY-384253: I think you guys can move on from this story, it's not going to happen
KEY-384254: I thought I was doing a good job given the circumstances and we were moving in the right direction. In that context it certainly appears a bit harsh
KEY-384255: I thought my management was having a negative effect on the team and that wasn't fair on the fans, so I did what I thought was the right thing in moving aside
KEY-384256: I thought this could've been [%nation#1] year but it wasn't to be. There's always next year
KEY-384257: I tried but he made it clear that his mind was made up. I'm sure he'll be a success at whatever he chooses to do next
KEY-384258: I understand his reaction entirely, it's embarrassing in many cases, but I felt it was in the team's best interests
KEY-384259: I want my players to assert themselves on the contest and not give them a second's rest. If that means playing on the edge or worse then so be it
KEY-384260: I was a bit disappointed really; part of the charm of continental competition is facing unfamiliar teams but instead we play somebody from our own back yard
KEY-384261: I was absolutely shocked; I don't think anybody saw it coming and it seems especially harsh on somebody I know to be a fantastic manager
KEY-384262: I was delighted to see [%team#2-short] qualify alongside us; we'll be better prepared to face them than we would have some other teams from abroad
KEY-384263: I was pleased with the performance and am optimistic about going on to take full advantage of it
KEY-384264: I was quite disappointed with his reaction. It lacked professionalism
KEY-384265: I watched both Semi Finals and I have to say that I thought they were both fortunate to get through. I'd say there are stronger leagues out there
KEY-384266: I won't allow complacency; there's football to be played and we'll see what happens
KEY-384267: I won't be drawn into making bold claims but we'll definitely give it everything to try to qualify from the group
KEY-384271: I won't let the rule book prevent this club from attracting players of the highest possible calibre. We'll deal with whatever arises after the fact
KEY-384272: I work with the guy every day and he couldn't be happier to be here. His long-term future is at this club
KEY-384277: I would like the board to consider setting up an affiliation with a club in order to secure first options on players from a successful youth system.
KEY-384278: I would like the board to consider setting up an affiliation with a club to enable us to send players abroad to secure work permits.
KEY-384279: I would like the board to consider setting up an affiliation with a club to enable us to send players out on loan.
KEY-384280: I would like the board to consider setting up an affiliation with a club to improve our scouting network's knowledge.
KEY-384281: I would like the board to consider setting up an affiliation with a club which can provide us a chance to recruit foreign youngsters.
KEY-384282: I would like the board to consider setting up an affiliation with a club which can share their training facilities with us.
KEY-384284: I would never rule it out but I'd prefer to remain in [%nation#1] if given a choice
KEY-384285: I would never rule it out but I'd prefer to work in [%nation#1] if given a choice
KEY-384286: I would say you can certainly expect us to venture into that territory in the near future, yes
KEY-384287: I wouldn't agree with that to be honest. I think anyone's first job in management will be a tough one
KEY-384288: I wouldn't expect them to be in any danger of going down. They've got plenty of points and have enough in the tank to still take care of business
KEY-384289: I wouldn't expect them to be very high. There are some really good teams from elsewhere that project as strong contenders
KEY-384291: I wouldn't jump to that conclusion right now. There's a lot going on that isn't in the public domain so you'll just have to be patient
KEY-384292: I wouldn't necessarily go along with that, although you'd have to say that both clubs exceeded expectations this year
KEY-384293: I wouldn't say I was surprised; there were a few signs of things going badly there and teams have to act accordingly in those circumstances
KEY-384294: I wouldn't worry about that, we've got strong characters in this team and these are the sort of games they live for
KEY-384295: I'd be very surprised if there was much domestic support for us outside of our own fan base. It's all about us as far as I'm concerned
KEY-384296: I'd be very surprised if there was much domestic support for us outside of our own fan base
KEY-384297: I'd do it again too; the players know that these things happen and they're obliged to handle it in a professional manner
KEY-384301: I'd have preferred it had he not retired but we can't turn back time now. We've got players with experience so I'm sure we'll be fine
KEY-384303: I'd love for that to happen, it'd make things extra special, but it's a long way off yet
KEY-384304: I'd love to have more people like him here; that connection to the supporters is vital
KEY-384305: I'd play these fixtures every week were it possible. My players don't need motivating for big matches and tend to play better in them too
KEY-384306: I'd prefer to be managing a team, there's no doubt about that, but with the circumstances as they are I'm taking the opportunity to watch a lot of football and pick the brains of some of the finest minds in the game in order to broaden my knowledge
KEY-384309: I'd rather be in charge of my team than his. One swallow doesn't make a summer
KEY-384310: I'd rather be in charge of my team than his. We deserved to win and he knows it
KEY-384311: I'd rather be in charge of my team than his. He's been around the block enough times to know this doesn't mean very much at all
KEY-384312: I'd rather be spending these precious moments preparing rather than wasting it talking to you lot
KEY-384314: I'd rather have won, that's for sure. Hopefully it's just a bump in the road and not a sign of a fall further down the league table
KEY-384315: I'd rather have won, that's for sure. Hopefully it's just a bump in the road and not a sign of being dragged into the turmoil of a relegation battle
KEY-384316: I'd rather have won, that's for sure. Hopefully it's just a bump in the road and not a sign of something more serious
KEY-384318: I'll be encouraging the players to approach the match with the same strength of feeling as the supporters have. Whatever happens, happens
KEY-384319: I'll be plain and up front about it, it was purely out of self-interest. If things became really bad it'd have affected my stock as a manager
KEY-384320: I'll discuss that after the match if it's all the same to everybody here
KEY-384321: I'll enjoy it for now because it's going to be hard to stay where we are, let alone move up any further
KEY-384322: I'll enjoy it while it lasts because I don't think it'll be for very long!
KEY-384323: I'll enjoy it while it lasts because I don't think it's going to last unfortunately
KEY-384324: I'll enjoy it while it lasts but it won't be a long-term thing; the table will take proper shape later in the season
KEY-384325: I'll enjoy it while it lasts; the table will take proper shape later in the season
KEY-384327: I'll miss him and so will the club. It's important to find a suitable replacement as soon as possible
KEY-384328: I'll miss him and so will the club. It's important to find a suitable replacement as soon as possible
KEY-384330: I'm a big believer in [%nation#1-nationality] football and although it doesn't seem like it I really think it could happen
KEY-384331: I'm a big fan of [%person#2-first] work and he'll doubtless ensure his side give us a game
KEY-384332: I'm a big fan of his so it was really nice to hear that
KEY-384333: I'm a manager; I always want to win. The fans determine how much it matters in terms of rivalry and bragging rights
KEY-384334: I'm absolutely devastated. This team would have survived in so many other seasons but we just happened upon a much tougher circumstance this time
KEY-384335: I'm already over it; it'd obviously have been nice to win but now we're all just really looking forward to working hard for the rest of the season in an effort to be as good as possible
KEY-384336: I'm cautiously optimistic; as long as our roles are clearly defined then I see no reason we can't co-exist
KEY-384337: I'm certainly not out of touch. I've been a keen observer of the game for years and feel the time is right for this sort of challenge
KEY-384338: I'm choosing to remain optimistic at this stage; it's nothing more than a minor setback and there's a lot of football yet to be played
KEY-384339: I'm choosing to remain optimistic at this stage; we'll pick ourselves up and try to do better next time
KEY-384340: I'm clued up on them, they're a good team and wouldn't be here if they didn't deserve to be
KEY-384341: I'm confident of a strong showing; it's hard to make specific predictions but we'll be as good as anyone else
KEY-384342: I'm confident of finishing well; however many points that leaves us with doesn't matter, we should be fine
KEY-384343: I'm delighted I managed to change his mind. I don't think he realised how important he was to us
KEY-384344: I'm delighted to welcome [%person#2-first] and hopefully we can build a successful working relationship that benefits everyone here
KEY-384345: I'm delighted; we had no real plan for that sort of situation so it required everyone to step up and [%male#2-first] was incredible
KEY-384346: I'm desperate to get back into the game as soon as possible. It's what I do and anything else is simply a waste of time for me
KEY-384347: I'm disappointed at the result but, considering the circumstances, I think we did as well as we could. [%male#2-first] was brilliant
KEY-384348: I'm disappointed; football is all about reacting to adversity and we didn't do that well today
KEY-384349: I'm expecting a real challenge and a tough ninety minutes, there's no doubt about that
KEY-384350: I'm extremely disappointed; we had the chance to control our own destiny for the rest of the season but that advantage lies elsewhere now
KEY-384351: I'm focused solely on preparing for the match and have nothing to say about anything surrounding it
KEY-384352: I'm going to take some time to properly understand why things went wrong and then plan for the future to ensure they don't happen again
KEY-384353: I'm gutted, it's such a shame for someone of his quality to be missing out
KEY-384356: I'm happy with recent performances so there's no need to tweak that particular formula
KEY-384357: I'm here to build something lasting and profound; this is just the first match in what I hope will be a long era of success, and it doesn't matter how long I've been here
KEY-384358: I'm honoured that he feels so strongly about it; it means I'm still relevant!
KEY-384359: I'm in a rather unique position of being extremely knowledgeable about them and so I think we've got the upper hand already
KEY-384360: I'm in the dark about them like most of you are. I'll doubtless get to know them well though
KEY-384361: I'm keen for us not to dwell on this story and focus on moving forward if we can please
KEY-384362: I'm keen to be involved in these rivalries for as long as possible because it means we're relevant
KEY-384363: I'm keen to be involved in these rivalries for as long as possible; they need to be preserved and cherished
KEY-384364: I'm looking forward to it. We're up against some good teams but we certainly fancy our chances
KEY-384365: I'm looking forward to seeing what he has to offer. The deal is done and now it's up to us to make the best of it
KEY-384366: I'm more concerned about beating them. If it's on their patch all the better
KEY-384367: I'm never happy with a result like this one; it doesn't particularly matter that it happened to be against [%person#2-first]
KEY-384369: I'm not as knowledgeable as I would like to be, but fortunately I have a wonderful scouting department available for assistance
KEY-384370: I'm not at all convinced that they won't regret this appointment in the not-so-distant future
KEY-384371: I'm not certain that [%person#2-first] is right for that job at this point in his career. They may well have made a huge mistake
KEY-384372: I'm not certain that [%person#2-first] is right for that job. They may well have made a huge mistake
KEY-384374: I'm not entirely sure right now but I'm not likely to second-guess a potential signing because of a silly rule
KEY-384375: I'm not especially keen on it having been included in the contract because it weakens the club's position and almost inevitably means we're likely to lose him
KEY-384376: I'm not especially keen on it making it easier for another team to come in and make him an offer but what's done is done and we'll have to get on with it
KEY-384377: I'm not getting ahead of myself; we're in a good position but it's going to be very hard to stay there at this stage of the campaign
KEY-384379: I'm not going to give much away but we're going to play with a good tempo and plenty of passion
KEY-384381: I'm not going to sit here under some false pretence and suggest that I'm better than that; of course I regret things. I wanted this to work out perfectly and it hasn't, so there's your regret right there
KEY-384384: I'm not paying attention to that right now, there's far too much football to be played for it to be of any real relevance at this stage
KEY-384385: I'm not paying attention to that, we've got plenty of bigger fish to fry and we're focused on the next match
KEY-384386: I'm not really sure myself. It certainly takes a bit of adjusting to, that's for sure
KEY-384387: I'm not so stupid as to think we can't still go down. We're going to play as hard as we can for every single point
KEY-384388: I'm not sure I would; it's important to keep climbing the ladder after all
KEY-384389: I'm not sure about that. Quite often, great players have been average managers at best and great managers had modest playing careers
KEY-384391: I'm not too sure because it involves plenty of other parties. I'd rather it wasn't a long and drawn-out process but it inevitably will be
KEY-384393: I'm only concerned about winning the competition. It could be played on the Moon for all I care
KEY-384395: I'm only interested in winning; it doesn't matter who we're playing or what the fans think of the match
KEY-384396: I'm optimistic by nature but that doesn't mean anything will happen
KEY-384397: I'm paid to manage [%team#1-short] and that's all I'm going to discuss
KEY-384398: I'm pleased to be facing what has to be considered a weaker team. With all due respect to [%team#2-short], going into a match like this as favourites is a huge boost for us
KEY-384399: I'm pleased with how we played and what we've come away with; it doesn't really matter who it came against but a point has been proven nonetheless
KEY-384400: I'm pleased with the result but not surprised; this is a terrific bunch of players and they never ever let me down
KEY-384401: I'm pleased with where we're at and I hope we've done enough, but we'll keep going until it's certain
KEY-384402: I'm pleased. There will be little by way of expectation on us to win but I don't think it's as hard as some people will say. [%team#2-short] aren't that big of a challenge, we can certainly give them a game
KEY-384403: I'm pretty good at remaining detached from things. I think that's important in this job
KEY-384404: I'm privileged to work with a very well-rounded group of players; in situations like this I just have to light the fuse and off they go
KEY-384405: I'm quite excited; he's very good at what he does and that can only be great for the team
KEY-384406: I'm quite nervous about it actually, I don't know how it's going to go but I do hope for a nice reaction from the [%team#2-short] supporters at least
KEY-384407: I'm ready and waiting to consign him to another defeat and perhaps heap the pressure on him again. Imagine if he was sacked because he lost to me!
KEY-384408: I'm ready for it and I'm excited. Putting everything else aside, this is certainly going to be an interesting one
KEY-384409: I'm ready for it. It'll be a very strange experience but one I'm certainly looking forward to
KEY-384410: I'm ready for it. They're a good team but we've got enough about us to get a result
KEY-384411: I'm ready to get stuck in; it's all well and good having training sessions under your belt but it doesn't truly begin until we get out on the pitch and play for real
KEY-384412: I'm ready to get stuck into a bit of good-natured media fun with him if that's what he wants
KEY-384413: I'm ready to get underway with the players at my disposal; let's talk about them instead
KEY-384414: I'm relieved we got there, even if the fates smiled upon us a bit
KEY-384415: I'm still hopeful in some ways but I don't expect there's a very strong chance of it
KEY-384416: I'm still too numb to be able to react to this with any real perspective
KEY-384417: I'm sure everybody would notice if it wasn't on the schedule, that's for sure
KEY-384418: I'm sure it'll be watched by plenty and well-received by just as many. It's the sort of fixture only the [%comp#1-short] can provide
KEY-384419: I'm sure we'll receive great backing from our supporters and that'll soon do away with any doubts that may be lingering
KEY-384420: I'm trying to look at it in a positive light and be as constructive as possible. It'll give me the chance to take a short break, refresh myself and begin the process of focusing on whatever I choose to do next
KEY-384421: I'm trying to move on from it; it's not healthy to look back and second-guess everything because hindsight will always be 20/20. Let's focus on the future
KEY-384422: I'm under no illusions about how long it'll take to get things the way I like them here; expecting everything to be in place for the first match would've been churlish to say the least
KEY-384423: I'm under no illusions that [%male#2-first] may well eventually move on but, for the time being at least, it'll take a lot to snatch him out of our hands
KEY-384424: I'm under no illusions that [%male#2-first] may well eventually move on but, for the time being at least, we can control the market for him if and when it develops
KEY-384426: I'm very keen to say hello and set the record straight face to face. A lot of stuff got blown out of proportion and I expect he understands that
KEY-384427: I'm very much looking forward to returning to management but it needs to be with the right team and the right opportunity for me
KEY-384428: I'm very pleased, yes. [%male#2-first] still has a lot to give at this level and will go on to show that over the course of the coming months
KEY-384429: I'm very pleased; [%male#2-first] has committed himself to the club and I'm looking forward to many more years of working with him
KEY-384434: I've always been of the belief that the buck stops with the manager and that he should have the utmost authority, so this is good news as far as I'm concerned
KEY-384435: I've always known that the release clause was likely to end up coming into play and if it does, we'll have to deal with that
KEY-384436: I've always stated that what goes on behind the dressing room doors stays there and that won't change now
KEY-384437: I've always wanted to be a football manager and I'm delighted [%team#1] have given me this opportunity. Age doesn't come into it for me
KEY-384439: I've got a decent idea about them and by the time we play them will know everything I need to
KEY-384440: I've got a few changes to make; you'll have to wait and see though
KEY-384441: I've got a nagging feeling that the fates will conspire to drag them back in. Nobody's safe yet
KEY-384442: I've got better things to do than to listen to him right now. No disrespect intended, but I've got plenty to do having only just taken over here!
KEY-384443: I've got no complaints, we weren't good enough
KEY-384444: I've got to hold my tongue at the moment; if I don't I may say something I regret
KEY-384445: I've had this one circled on my calendar ever since it became apparent we'd be going head-to-head. He'll be choking on his words when we're through with his team
KEY-384446: I've inherited a professional bunch of players who know they're expected to meet certain standards. I have complete faith that they will
KEY-384447: I've just been waiting for the right offer to come along and, now that it has, I'm ready to prove those critics wrong
KEY-384448: I've made it unequivocally clear to the players that I want to see a positive reaction
KEY-384449: I've never been especially big on delegating tasks but it's becoming increasingly hard to avoid doing so. I expect [%person#2-first] will fill in the gaps
KEY-384450: I've no airs or graces about where I work; if I believe in the project and that team believes in me then so be it
KEY-384451: I've not thought about it too much, we'll have to see what offers come along I guess
KEY-384452: I've only considered it in passing but I'm definitely open to the suggestion
KEY-384453: I've said all along that I'm happy with my current squad. We're not bringing anybody in and I'm looking forward to a peaceful deadline day
KEY-384454: I've seen better, it's nothing special for me
KEY-384455: My blood pressure is through the roof after the stress of that one; it'll take a while before I can fully appreciate what happened!
KEY-384456: My decisions, the reasoning behind them and how we handle the consequences will all remain internal matters
KEY-384458: You begin the new campaign without [%male#2] following his retirement last season. How hopeful are you that his presence and his experience won't be missed?
KEY-384459: You clearly like to keep your cards close to your chest but the [%team#1-short] supporters will want an answer. Are you pursuing [%male#2]?
KEY-384462: You made the unusual decision to substitute [%male#2] in the [%number#1-nth] minute with the player himself having previously come off the bench. Why did you do it and do you understand his unhappiness at the situation?
KEY-384463: You must be delighted that he's going to remain a [%team#1-short] player then? How soon will it be wrapped up?
KEY-384464: You must be looking forward to your first match in charge against [%team#2-short] on [%date#1-day]?
KEY-384465: You tend to play the percentages in tight and tense fixtures. Read into that what you will
KEY-384466: You were forced into using [%male#2] in goal during today's match; how much do you think that affected the outcome?
KEY-384467: You were forced into using [%male#2] in goal during today's match; how much more pleasing is the result with that in mind?
KEY-384468: You've been linked extensively with [%male#2], is he the player you're talking about?
KEY-384469: You've chosen to leave [%male#2] out of the starting eleven; when can we expect him to get his first start for the club?
KEY-384470: You've had very little time to prepare for your first match in charge against [%team#2-short]; how much - if at all - will that impact upon your performance?
KEY-384472: You've left [%male#2] out; is that due to his recent injury problems?
KEY-384476: Your [%comp#1-short] squad is notable for the absence of [%male#2] despite having clear room to include him. Can you explain what happened there?
KEY-384477: Your [%comp#1-short] squad is notable for the absence of [%male#2], who was presumably omitted as a result of rules and regulations. How much of a blow is that to your plans?
KEY-384480: Your decision to go out and bring in [%male#2] was clearly influenced by [%team#1-short] [%position#2-general] injury crisis. Are you confident that he can be an effective contributor until some of the recent casualties are fit to return?
KEY-384481: Your first match in charge is a tough one against [%team#2-short]. How well are you prepared for that sort of test first up?
KEY-384482: Your first match in charge is a tough one against a noted rival in [%team#2-short]. How well are you prepared for that sort of test first up?
KEY-384483: Your first match in charge is against [%team#2-short] in the [%comp#1-short]. How well are you prepared for that sort of test first up?
KEY-384484: Your first match in charge just happens to be against [%team#2-short]. How do you feel going up against your former team quite so soon?
KEY-384485: Your playing career was a huge success at this sort of level but management is a new challenge for you. Do you think your experience will aid the transition at all?
KEY-384486: Your side dominated the ball today with [%number#1]% possession but you somehow find yourself on the losing side. Just how did that happen?
KEY-384487: Your team today has been heavily impacted by international call-ups. How do you see that affecting the match?
KEY-384488: [%person#1-first], how are you adjusting to unemployment following your departure from [%team#2-short]?
KEY-384523: [%person#1-surname] 'gutted' to be without injured players ahead of [%fixture_name#1-nocomp]
KEY-384524: [%person#1-surname] 'gutted' to be without players ahead of [%fixture_name#1-nocomp]

KEY-384574: [%person#1-surname] confident [%team#1-short] can produce the goods in relegation battle
KEY-384598: [%person#1-surname] delighted to keep [%male#2-surname] on
KEY-384605: [%person#1-surname] disappointed at failure to beat [%person#2-surname]
KEY-384615: [%person#1-surname] disappointed to be knocked out of [%continent#1-continentality] football spot
KEY-384620: [%person#1-surname] disappointed with [%team#2-short] fixture
KEY-384621: [%person#1-surname] disappointed with outcome following goalkeeper debacle
KEY-384622: [%person#1-surname] disappointed with result versus [%person#2-surname]
KEY-384632: [%person#1-surname] doesn't expect [%team#1-short] to qualify for [%continent#1-continentality] football
KEY-384636: [%person#1-surname] doesn't expect much support from back in [%nation#1-nationality]

KEY-385442: A poor result for you and I'm sure you're already aware that [%team#2-short] have won today. How significant could today become at the end of the season?

KEY-385460: Child competition [%comp#1] (child of [%comp#2]) cannot itself be a parent competition of other competitions
KEY-385465: Despite your side languishing towards the bottom of the possession rankings, results have been good. Do you think possession is overrated?

KEY-385467: Despite racking up one of the league's highest average net expenditures, results have been lacking. Have you simply wasted a lot of money?
KEY-385468: Do you agree that a poor record in the transfer market contributed to your [%team#2-short] downfall?

KEY-385480: Dropping points today really opens the door for [%team#2-short], who play their fixture later than you. You will surely be watching and hoping someone can do you a favour?

KEY-385489: Football is a law unto itself and, as the cliché goes, it's also a universal language. My linguistic versatility doesn't really amount to very much as far as management goes

KEY-385493: Having been linked with the [%team#2-short] job, how enticing is the opportunity of working with such abundant resources?
KEY-385494: Having been linked with the [%team#2-short] job, how would you feel about taking over at a club with such a bleak financial outlook?
KEY-385497: He took his protests too far there and has received his marching orders for what appears to be abuse directed towards an official
KEY-385498: He took his protests too far there and received his marching orders for what appeared to be abuse directed towards an official
KEY-385501: He's a good player; one many managers would love to have in their team. Any talk of a transfer deal is premature however
KEY-385502: He's been a fantastic servant to the club and has earned the right to do things on his terms
KEY-385503: He's certainly got plenty more to offer and we'll be looking to get that from him

KEY-385509: How do you know he wasn't here simply to enjoy our terrific football?

KEY-385511: If I am ever to be replaced in this job it'll take a much better manager than him. He's not even close to the required standard
KEY-385512: If I had the budget to operate with a bigger squad I would, but I don't, so here we are
KEY-385516: If given the job, I feel confident in my ability to better the proposed expectation and guide the team to a mid-table finish.
KEY-385517: If given the job, I would be able to meet the expectation proposed and challenge for automatic promotion.
KEY-385518: If given the job, I would expect to go well beyond the proposed expectation and get the team challenging for an automatic promotion place.
KEY-385519: If given the job, I would expect to slightly better the proposed expectation and finish in a mid-table league position.
KEY-385520: If given the job, I would hope to do slightly better than has been proposed and get the team involved in the automatic promotion race.

KEY-385534: Is there increased pressure on you because you're going to be following on directly from somebody as revered as [%person#2]?
KEY-385535: It all comes back to me. It's my job to put the team in the best possible position to succeed and I've not done that
KEY-385536: It all starts with hard work really, the players are prepared to put in the effort to get better and it pays off on the pitch
KEY-385537: It can only be a good thing to broaden my managerial horizons but, in the absence of anything concrete, it would be inappropriate to comment further
KEY-385538: It doesn't have to mean anything. I am [%team#1-short] manager and I remain fully committed to that job
KEY-385540: It might help us pick up a point or two but it's not the quick fix many would have you believe; we've got a lot of work to do
KEY-385542: It wasn't a decision I took lightly but I firmly feel it's for the best
KEY-385545: It'd be a dream come true to manage them, the club is very special to me and I'd do anything to see them succeed
KEY-385546: It'll be a big part of what we do but I won't neglect other areas of the team; it's pointless being able to run all day long if you don't know where you're supposed to be running
KEY-385547: It'll be a big part of what we do but I won't sacrifice other areas of the team; I won't leave my job security in the hands of a bunch of teenagers
KEY-385548: It'll give us a boost in so many different areas; if we can use it to help us win then all the better
KEY-385549: It's my job to make sure we're as well-rounded a team as possible regardless of my own tactical preferences
KEY-385550: It's a chastening experience but one I'm trying to approach with optimism. I'm looking forward to the future already
KEY-385551: It's a great way to introduce myself to the fans. They're accustomed to watching a certain style of play and I can assure them that things will remain as they like it
KEY-385553: It's a personal passion as much as anything but I have far too many other responsibilities to even begin thinking about having that level of influence here
KEY-385554: It's a poorly-kept secret that things weren't going well and I've sort of been preparing for this for a while now
KEY-385555: It's all a part of a much bigger plan to define and create a style that stands the test of time here
KEY-385556: It's all well and good covering a lot of ground but I have to look at how exactly he's doing it and whether it benefits the team. It's not always a positive
KEY-385557: It's an absolute honour to be replacing a manager of his quality and reputation; I couldn't have wished for a better opportunity
KEY-385559: It's an unfortunate part of the game and it could easily be me in the same situation with a few poor results. It's never nice to see another manager out of work, especially somebody I've spent a lot of time with
KEY-385560: It's an unfortunate part of the game and it could easily be me in the same situation with a few poor results. It's never nice to see another manager out of work
KEY-385562: It's difficult but that's football. I can't pretend I'm not disappointed to be leaving
KEY-385563: It's easy to speculate from the outside but only those at the club know the exact reasons why the decision was made and perhaps you could say it has been coming
KEY-385564: It's exciting to even think about the potential of what could be achieved if I were to have those riches at my disposal
KEY-385565: It's generally understood that you favour [%formation#1] formation. Does the fact that [%team#1-short] have historically played that way help your settling process?
KEY-385566: It's going to be a really tough battle to qualify and everyone will have their moments of promise. We just have to make sure we finish there when it's all said and done
KEY-385567: It's going to be hard enough to end up finishing in the right place, let alone hope for help from elsewhere
KEY-385569: It's hard to argue against what they're doing; it's obviously what they think is best
KEY-385570: It's just one of a number of absolute fundamentals I demand of the players in order to take us to where we want to be
KEY-385571: It's mainly due to bad luck. A few things have gone against us this season and that, combined with trying to field the strongest possible team, has led to a higher turnover of players in the matchday squad
KEY-385573: It's nothing more than testing the water with my future in mind. Nothing formal has been discussed with anybody
KEY-385574: It's nothing other teams won't have at their disposal and, even if they don't speak multiple languages, there's always a way to get things done
KEY-385575: It's obviously a much-talked about subject but I truly believe young talent must be harnessed and not allowed to stagnate, so that's the approach I'll be taking
KEY-385576: It's obviously something different to most managers but it's an increasingly important aspect of the game and it's something I take very seriously
KEY-385577: It's perfectly understandable on their part; they have what they consider to be an asset they're not prepared to part with and I have to live with that
KEY-385578: It's something I've favoured during my development and will naturally be an area I focus on heavily in this job as a result
KEY-385579: It's something I've favoured during my development and will naturally be an area I look towards as a strength here
KEY-385580: It's something I've found very enjoyable during my development and will naturally be an area I focus on heavily in this job as a result
KEY-385581: It's vital. Playing at home comes with a statistically proven advantage and it's where we expect to win most of our points
KEY-385582: It's water off a duck's back to me, I'm not interested in paper talk
KEY-385585: Let's wait and see what the future brings; I won't be drawn into too many specifics at this point

KEY-385591: Many people have suggested that your low overall net transfer expenditure is closely connected to poor results on the pitch. Do you need to splash the cash to succeed?
KEY-385596: Of course I know [%person#2-first] well but I don't know him as a manager and therefore maybe [%team#2-short] are best placed to make a decision many saw as likely to happen
KEY-385599: Oh of course, we'd all love to qualify, and hopefully things will work out well if we can just do our part
KEY-385600: On balance, I'm happy to be out of that environment. It wasn't going to do me much good staying there in the long-term

KEY-385701: We don't really have the depth to rotate in the manner some other teams do. We have to work with the tools at our disposal
KEY-385702: We have to continue spending in order to maintain the quality and depth of the squad
KEY-385703: We have to find every advantage we possibly can and a lot of that can come from something as simple as set pieces. We work hard to make a success of them
KEY-385704: We'll have to wait and see how it affects things but it's always good to be on the positive side of something like this
KEY-385705: We're going to begin looking to the future and the time is right for the transition away from [%male#2-first] to begin
KEY-385706: We're going to need a little bit of luck for sure and hopefully someone comes through and does us a favour
KEY-385707: We're led to believe that you're quite adept at coaching goalkeepers. How do you intend to factor that into your day-to-day management?
KEY-385708: We're led to believe that you're quite heavily focused on the fitness side of the game. How do you intend to factor that into your day-to-day management?
KEY-385709: We're led to believe that you're quite heavily focused on the integration of younger talent. How do you intend to factor that into your day-to-day management?
KEY-385710: We're led to believe that you're very much a defence-minded coach. How do you intend to factor that into your day-to-day management?
KEY-385711: We're led to believe that you're very much an attack-minded coach. How do you intend to factor that into your day-to-day management?
KEY-385712: We've had some shocking decisions against us but I think referees will always naturally favour the home team because of the crowd
KEY-385715: We've now got to focus on the biggest task of all. People might think winning that one is unrealistic but nobody thought we'd get this far and we've proven them wrong
KEY-385716: We've really been forced into it. When you factor in rotation, injuries and suspensions it can all add up quite quickly
KEY-385717: We've really been unlucky. If you look back at the goals we've conceded some of them are ridiculous
KEY-385718: We've really been unlucky. If you look back at the manner in which we've missed some chances they've been laughable
KEY-385719: What are you going to do with yourself after spending [%number#1] years in the [%team#2-short] job?
KEY-385721: What are your immediate thoughts in the wake of your departure from the [%team#2-short] job?
KEY-385722: What are your immediate thoughts in the wake of your resignation from the [%team#2-short] job?
KEY-385723: What are your thoughts on [%person#2] this week declaring his interest in possibly replacing you as [%team#1-short] manager?
KEY-385725: What are your thoughts on [%team#2-short] parting company with one of your former players in [%person#2]?
KEY-385726: What are your thoughts on rumours this week claiming [%person#2] is set to replace you as [%team#1-short] manager?
KEY-385727: What do you make of [%person#2] latest comments concerning [%male#3]?
KEY-385728: What does the rest of the season hold for [%male#2] after he agreed a move to [%team#2-short]?
KEY-385729: What is your opinion on [%team#2-short] parting with a hefty [%cash#1] in compensation in order to get [%person#2]?
KEY-385730: What was your reaction to being linked with such a high-profile job at [%team#2-short]?
KEY-385731: What was your reaction to being linked with the vacant managerial post at [%team#2-short], a club so dear to your heart?
KEY-385732: What was your reaction to being linked with the vacant managerial post at [%team#2-short]? Would you ever be tempted to go back there?
KEY-385733: Why did you decline [%team#2-short] invitation of an interview for their vacant manager's post?
KEY-385734: Why have you decided to step down now, fresh off the back of [%comp#1-short] victory?
KEY-385735: Will you be going back to your old club to bring some of your former colleagues into the backroom team here at [%stadium#1]?
KEY-385736: With all due respect to them, I'm not looking to work at that level
KEY-385741: You'll have to ask my employers if there's sufficient money available to go down that path
KEY-385743: [%job#1] [%person#1] recommends that you hold a team meeting to recognise our superb run of form. He believes that praising the players' recent efforts will help keep spirits high.
KEY-385770: [%male#2] has lashed out at your decision to place him on the transfer list. What's the next step here for you?
KEY-385771: [%male#2] has lashed out at the club's decision to make him available for loan. What's the next step here for you?
KEY-385772: [%male#2] has lashed out at the club's decision to offer his services around to other clubs. What's the next step here for you?
KEY-385773: [%male#2] has lashed out at the club's decision to place him on the transfer list. What's the next step here for you?
KEY-385774: [%male#2] is amongst the league leaders in average minutes per goal, finding the net roughly every [%number#1] minutes. Is there even more to come?
KEY-385780: [%nation#1-nationality] football isn't the biggest but we've got a strong team and could quite conceivably cause an upset or two
KEY-385781: [%nation#1] no longer has a team in the [%comp#1-short]. How disappointing is that for the [%comp#2-short]?
KEY-385789: I always prefer setting the pace rather than being the team doing the chasing, there's less pressure on us to react accordingly. They're going to face that pressure now and it'll be interesting to see if they can deal with it
KEY-385790: I believe every deal I made was in the club's best interests and, given time, that will become extremely clear
KEY-385791: I believe it's important to remain optimistic and to learn from the mistakes made here so as to not repeat them going forward
KEY-385792: I believe that harnessing the real foundations of the club's support is paramount to long-term success and hopefully my relatively local connections will help bring that along
KEY-385793: I believe the transfers were made for the right reasons and, given the chance, they'll show their true qualities
KEY-385794: I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times I genuinely felt I had the support of the club
KEY-385795: I can only do the best job I possibly can; it's impossible to compare myself to [%person#2-first] and I want to be judged on my own merits
KEY-385796: I can only hope so; this club has massive potential but we need the right infrastructure in place in order to fulfil it
KEY-385797: I can only work properly when I have the assurances of job security. That'd be simply impossible there
KEY-385799: I can't envisage a scenario in which a team of our limited resources could overcome a more powerful opponent in a big match
KEY-385800: I can't go into specific details but there was definitely a disagreement and it's all clearly come to a head
KEY-385801: I can't help but think we've been lucky and that at some point it'll dry up
KEY-385802: I can't say I've even begun to consider that. Where do you pluck these questions from?
KEY-385803: I certainly can't control what happens in the [%comp#2-short] so it's fairly pointless discussing it
KEY-385804: I certainly didn't want to leave and it wasn't meant to end this way, but what's done is done and I have to look towards the future now
KEY-385805: I certainly don't have any regrets and I don't think [%male#2-first] does either
KEY-385806: I certainly hope so; I'll be using my connections with the country as much as possible!
KEY-385807: I certainly hope we can. It's never easy to win matches in this league but we're in with a chance and that's a good place to start
KEY-385809: I challenge anyone to find a manager with a flawless transfer record. They weren't signed on a whim and we have to let them settle in and be comfortable before expecting the world of them
KEY-385810: I could not be prouder of what these boys have achieved. It's a remarkable feat and to win just one more huge match would be simply mind-blowing
KEY-385811: I couldn't ask to be in a better position; there's pressure in any job but at least here I'm surrounded by such terrific people
KEY-385812: I couldn't care less about that nonsense, it has nothing to do with me
KEY-385813: I definitely agree it's an expensive mistake if you make it and perhaps a change of approach is needed in the longer-term here
KEY-385815: I do regret him leaving; he should still be [%team#1-short] player
KEY-385816: I don't feel it was the right thing to do; my circumstances wouldn't have allowed me to go forward with them
KEY-385817: I don't know about that. They say never go back and for good reason; things are never quite the same the second time around, are they?
KEY-385818: I don't know about that; I'm sure the staff here are more than adequate and it's incumbent upon me to get the best out of them now
KEY-385819: I don't know about that; sometimes we need to be happy with what we've got and work out how to simply maintain it
KEY-385821: I don't know if those stories are true in the first place, but part of me is wary about the prospect of failing and living to regret it were I ever to manage there
KEY-385822: I don't know what the future holds right now, but there's no need to rush into anything
KEY-385823: I don't know what to expect, we're just going to try our best and see what happens
KEY-385824: I don't know whether it would be as good as it seems; there'd be immense pressure and no assurances of success
KEY-385825: I don't like the idea I'll be forever measured against [%person#2-first] achievements but that comes with the territory here doesn't it?
KEY-385827: I don't really see the value in discussions about statistics. They don't tell you much about anything
KEY-385829: I don't think it does anybody any good to harbour resentment and ill feeling. What's done is done and we can each go our separate ways now
KEY-386105: You appeared, from the outside at least, to enjoy a fairly strong relationship with the [%team#2-short] board so this has come as something of a surprise to many.
KEY-386106: You appeared, from the outside at least, to regularly be at odds with the [%team#2-short] board so this hasn't exactly come as a surprise to many of us.
KEY-386108: You do have some connection with [%nation#1]; does that help at all with your acclimatisation to the job?
KEY-386109: You hail from relatively close by; does that help at all in getting the fans onside with your appointment?
KEY-386110: You must be disappointed to be leaving [%team#2-short] over a contractual dispute of all things?
KEY-386111: You must be disappointed to be leaving [%team#2-short] without having been able to achieve the targets set out by the board?
KEY-386112: You must be disappointed to be leaving [%team#2-short] without having been able to turn around a poor run of form?
KEY-386113: You never really enjoyed a healthy relationship with the [%team#2-short] supporters; to what extent did that play a role in your departure?
KEY-386114: You seem to be handling things very well considering the circumstances...
KEY-386115: You spent just [%number#1] days in charge of [%team#2-short]; you surely can't have expected to stay for such a brief period of time?
KEY-386116: You weren't able to get the win today but is there at least some consolation in the fact that [%team#2-short] also failed to collect a win today?
KEY-386117: You'll remember [%male#2] plea to [%male#3] to stay at [%team#1-short] before his eventual decision to leave; with the benefit of hindsight how do you now see the situation?
KEY-386118: You're a noted polyglot; how useful is your multilingualism in today's footballing culture?
KEY-386119: You've accumulated a higher net spend than many other teams in the league and it's paying off in terms of results. Can we expect the spending to carry on?
KEY-386120: You've been linked with a return to [%nation#1] in the form of potentially filling the [%team#2-short] vacancy. Is that something you'd be interested in?
KEY-386123: You've got one of the poorest attacking records in the division. Why can't you find the back of the net more often?
KEY-386125: You've managed to guide [%team#1-short] into the [%comp#1-short] Playoff Final, congratulations. How big of an achievement is this considering the size and stature of the club?
KEY-386126: You've put together quite the run of form away from home of late. What's the secret?
KEY-386127: You've struggled for form at home for a while now. Are you able to put a finger on the reason why?
KEY-386128: You've turned [%stadium#1] into something of a fortress in recent times. How important is a good home record?
KEY-386129: You've used a staggering [%number#1] players so far this season, the highest in the [%comp#1-short]; can you explain why that figure is so high?
KEY-386130: You've used just [%number#1] players so far this season, the lowest in the [%comp#1-short]; can you explain why that figure is so low?
KEY-386131: Your name has been bandied about in connection with the [%team#2-short] job. How do you feel about being linked with a lower-profile job?
KEY-386132: Your name has been linked with the vacant [%team#2-short] job in the past few days; how do you feel about the idea of working abroad?
KEY-386133: Your name has been linked with the vacant [%team#2-short] job in the past few days; how do you feel about the idea of working in international football?
KEY-386134: Your name has cropped up in connection with that [%team#2-short] job; how do you feel about being linked with a vacancy that has so far proved a struggle to fill?
KEY-386135: Your team are amongst the league leaders in creating clear cut chances. With such opportunities supposedly reflective of a team's dominance, how pleased are you with that statistic?
KEY-386136: Your team are amongst the league leaders in goals from direct free kicks. Is that something you spend time working on?
KEY-386137: Your team has enjoyed a significant possession advantage in the majority of matches yet struggle to pick up results. Why is that?
KEY-386139: Your team ranks amongst the best in the league at retaining possession. How important has that been to your consistently good form?
KEY-386141: has broken [%team#1-short] record single season transfer spend with [%cash#1-short-roundlarge] paid out.

KEY-386555: [%team#1-short] can potentially secure a place in the preliminary stages of the [%comp#1-short] in the next match but there's still a chance of making the [%comp#2-short]. Presumably you're going to be doing everything possible to ensure qualification for the latter?

KEY-391105: As we see it, there is plenty of opportunity to make further profit from the first-team squad and until that has happened, we will not consider accepting.
KEY-391106: Attaining a higher standard of academy grading would allow us to improve the overall quality both on and off the pitch. It's a no-brainer to accept this request.
KEY-391108: Board
KEY-391112: Come on, let's have a little ambition here. I know you guys are good enough to avoid the automatic relegation places.
KEY-391113: Congratulations on achieving promotion this season! I will be strengthening the squad as you might expect but I believe we can avoid getting involved in the relegation battle next term.
KEY-391114: Congratulations on achieving promotion this season! I will be strengthening the squad as you might expect but I believe we can avoid the automatic relegation places next term.
KEY-391115: Congratulations on achieving promotion this season! I'm more than happy to go into next season with you all and believe we can avoid getting involved in the relegation battle.
KEY-391116: Congratulations on achieving promotion this season! I'm more than happy to go into next season with you all and believe we can avoid the automatic relegation places.
KEY-391312: The club is not currently in a position to increase spending in this area so for now you'll have to work within the existing constraints.
KEY-391313: The money required for this would be better spent elsewhere in the club. We don't believe it would result in a marked increase in quality and we therefore have to reject the request.
KEY-391314: The potential of increased revenue streams alone would not be enough for us to consider such an ambitious project as to build a brand new stadium, so we have to reject the request.
KEY-391318: There's a world of difference between playing youth team football and getting meaningful experience in the adult game. These boys need that now.
KEY-391320: There's nothing to worry about; we've got lots of versatility in this squad and that means everyone will get more than their fair share of playing time too.
KEY-391322: They all know what's expected of them and they're paid accordingly. If they can't handle the current workload then they shouldn't be working here, and we won't allow you to expand the coaching team at this time either.
KEY-391323: They'll get over it; a number of other players are 'fan favourites' too, and they'll develop an affinity for players we sign in the future as well. It's not a good enough reason to put a halt to this deal.
KEY-391324: This doesn't have to go outside of this office but I feel that the squad lacks depth in [%position#3-general] at the moment and want to know if you feel the same way?
KEY-391325: This doesn't have to go outside of this office but I feel that the squad lacks depth in the goalkeeping position at the moment and want to know if you feel the same way?
KEY-391327: This doesn't have to go outside of this office but I think you were too harsh on [%male#3] during the team talk you gave against [%team#4-short].
KEY-391328: This doesn't have to go outside of this office but I think you were too nice on [%male#3] during the team talk you gave against [%team#4-short] when he really required a sterner talking to.
KEY-391329: This doesn't have to go outside of this office but I think you were too nice on the team during the team talk you gave against [%team#3-short] when we really required a sterner talking to.
KEY-391332: This is a new regime and a lot of things are going to change around here, I think you should give it a few weeks to see if you still feel the same once I've settled in. We can talk about this again if you still feel the same way then.
KEY-391333: This is a new start for everybody at the club and everyone will have a chance to prove themselves to me, there's no reason you can't be a part of my plans if you work hard and force your way into my plans.
KEY-391334: This is getting out of hand, I don't want any more problems here; [%male#3-first] will be dropped from the first team to keep you happy.
KEY-391335: This is getting out of hand, I don't want this to cause even more issues so I'll look to sell [%male#3-first] as soon as possible.
KEY-391338: Training
KEY-391339: Transfers / Contracts
KEY-391345: Upon [%person#1] departure, the board decided that the loss of his experience and loyalty to the club could be remedied by promoting him to [%job#1]. However the board will, if requested, remove him from his newly-appointed role.
KEY-391346: We accept that there are positives to exploring our options overseas and so we're prepared to at least investigate the possibility of going forward with your request.
KEY-391349: We already have a relationship with a club in possession of better facilities and do not believe that we require another such affiliation.
KEY-391351: We are concerned that you seem to have lost the support of the dressing room, there are too many players who seem very unhappy about the way you've treated them or the way you've dealt with their team-mates. You're going to have to address their concerns and get them back on your side if you want to keep your job.
KEY-391352: We are keen to gauge your reaction on whether we should be looking to increase the percentage of transfer revenue made available to you.
KEY-391353: We are planning on keeping our previous manager [%person#3] at the club in a Director of Football role, how would you feel about this?
KEY-391354: We believe you are possibly overstating the strength of feeling towards [%male#3-first] from the fans and, with that in mind, this deal will go ahead as planned.
KEY-391356: We believe it would be beneficial to have somewhere to park some of our many youth players so we will agree to your request and begin making the necessary arrangement.
KEY-391359: We believe the club is already an attractive proposition for most players and that an expansion of the coaching ranks would have little tangible benefit.
KEY-391360: We believe the current available percentage of transfer revenue available to you is too restrictive and we will therefore approve an increase immediately.
KEY-391362: We believe the future of this club lies in the hands of those youngsters and, if this helps them realise their potential, then we're all for it.
KEY-391363: We can't afford to let [%male#3] join a rival team; he's a fantastic prospect and is too good to let slip away. I need the funds to bring him to this club.
KEY-391364: We can't constantly compare ourselves to our rivals in this area; we can only be as good as our standing allows us to be and we're not currently in a position to accept this request.
KEY-391367: We care deeply about the supporters and, if you believe they have such a strong affinity with [%male#3-first], we are prepared to cancel the deal.
KEY-391370: We could do with committing more money to the wage budget for our coaching staff. It's something that, if approved, would help the squad out tremendously.
KEY-391371: We could do with committing more money to the wage budget for our physiotherapy department. It's something that, if approved, would help the squad out tremendously.
KEY-391372: We could do with committing more money to the wage budget for our scouting department. It's something that, if approved, would help the club tremendously.
KEY-391373: We could do with committing more money to the wage budget for the Assistant Manager's role. It's something that, if approved, would help make my job a lot easier.
KEY-391374: We could do with committing more money to the wage budget for the Director of Football's role. It's a position of huge importance and we owe it to the club to make sure it's staffed as well as possible.
KEY-391375: We disagree; there is a wealth of talent not only in the club's immediate vicinity but also around the country. We should be focusing our efforts here rather than abroad.
KEY-391378: We don't believe revenue would increase sufficiently enough to warrant the expenditure required to expand the stadium. We're therefore inclined to reject the request.
KEY-391379: We don't believe there is sufficient value in developing our own players and cannot advocate spending money on the youth team's training facilities right now.
KEY-391412: We would be reluctant to scale things back even further than they currently stand; it would be detrimental to the club's progress and we must therefore reject the request.
KEY-391627: [%person#2-surname] believes that the mistake [%male#1-surname] made which led to a goal in his last match highlights his unsuitability for his currently assigned role.
KEY-391628: [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] edged out in tight contest
KEY-391629: [%team#1-short] can secure a place in next season's [%comp#5-short] with just a point against [%team#2-short] and if results elsewhere go in their favour, but will still be looking for a place in the [%comp#6].
KEY-391631: {upper}[%male#1-surname] only made [%number#21] appearances for [%team#1-short] since joining for [%cash#2-roundlarge], costing the club a princely [%cash#20-roundlarge] per match when taking into account his sale fee.
KEY-391666: A key aspect of the match to watch is whether [%team#1-short] are able to continue their excellent aerial prowess against [%team#2-short] team that appears incapable of preventing headed goals from being conceded.
KEY-391667: A new contract would signal to the players that I'm going to be here for the long haul and could potentially help to win over any of those who have lingering doubts about my future.
KEY-391671: After last season's promotions and relegations, [%comp#1-short] has [%number#2] extra teams, taking it to [%number#1] in total.

KEY-391718: Does that result prove you were right when defending the experience in your squad before the match?

KEY-391738: Following a rule change, the [%comp#1] average points table, which is used to decide the relegation places, will now be calculated over the past [%number#1] seasons instead of [%number#2].
KEY-391740: Game - Start a new Football Manager Touch game
KEY-391741: Give me two years and I promise you'll see the benefits of improving our training facilities in a tangible way.
KEY-391905: You all deserve to be congratulated for staving off the threat of relegation this season. We're going to work hard to make sure we avoid the automatic relegation places next time around.
KEY-391906: You're right, we are underachieving, that's why I've been given the task of turning it around. I'll need everybody on board, including you so get your head down, work hard and we'll see where we are once I've had a chance to improve the situation.

KEY-391942: [%male#1] and [%male#2] each like to impose their undeniable abilities on proceedings in the middle of the park and, as they go head-to-head here, the victor in their own personal battle will in turn help their team's chances of winning.
KEY-391943: [%male#1] and [%person#2] continue to find themselves embroiled in a bitter dispute inside [%team#1-short] and, with their animosity having reached a tipping point, many are waiting for one or the other to depart the club.
KEY-391952: [%male#1] has racked up the assists so far but is now faced with a sterner test as he goes up against [%team#2-short] staunch defence.

KEY-392617: A mid-table position suggests so far so good for [%team#1-short], but recent performances seem more fitting for a team expected to struggle, especially one having been hit by a points deduction.
KEY-392618: A press conference could be scheduled at [%stadium#1] later today after [%team#1] finalised a trade for [%person_list#1].
KEY-392619: A thrilling [%date#1-day] is in the offing at [%stadium#1] this evening as [%team_description#2] [%team#2-short] travel to [%team_description#1] [%team#1-short] with both sides fighting desperately to secure a place in the middle section of the league after the split.

KEY-392625: Afk
KEY-392626: After confounding critics and fans for some time following their points deduction, [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] promotion challenge is starting to slip away. [BRK_LN] The team's recent displays on the pitch suggest that the chance of remaining in contention is slim.
KEY-392627: After stunning the pundits with their early season form in the wake of a points deduction, [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] still find themselves chasing a promotion place. [BRK_LN] Recent form suggests however that, even at long odds for promotion, nobody is going to get rich at the bookmakers with this club this season.
KEY-392628: Against all expectations after a points deduction, [%team#1-short] continue to perform well and however improbable it may sound, they may keep going right to the wire in the title chase.
KEY-392629: All eyes will be on [%stadium#1] this evening as [%team_description#1] [%team#1-short] push to secure a place in the middle section of the league after the split.

KEY-392637: Although [%team#1-short] poor run just came to an end, it does seem unlikely that they can hang on for continental qualification, with the true impact of their points deduction beginning to be felt.
KEY-392638: Amazingly [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only], who were expected to struggle this year even before being hit with a points deduction, begin their final run-in ahead of the pack at the top of the division. [BRK_LN] If they can just continue their current form, they may yet confound the critics and pick up the title.
KEY-392642: As a team expected to struggle this season after a points deduction, [%team#1-nickname] find their early season form putting them amongst the title contenders. [BRK_LN] Their recent defeat however may well spell the end for the fans' optimism.
KEY-392643: As expected, [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans find their team just above the relegation places following their points deduction; but their current form could well see them avoid being dragged into the drop zone.
KEY-392644: As feared, [%team#1-short] find themselves close to the relegation battle following a points deduction and the end of their recent unbeaten run leaves them a little too close to the drop zone for comfort.
KEY-392645: As predicted following their points deduction, [%team#1-nickname] continue to under-perform and remain amongst the favourites for relegation.
KEY-392646: As predicted, [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] find themselves in a relegation spot following a points deduction but with half the season left to play, their current form suggests they may be more than capable of battling their way to safety.
KEY-392647: As the season reaches its climax, it seems the pundits were right when they predicted [%team#1-nickname] could go down. [BRK_LN] Despite some good recent performances, [%team#1-short] just do not look good enough to overcome their [%number#2]-point deduction and appear destined to succumb to relegation.
KEY-392648: As the season reaches its climax, it seems the pundits were right when they predicted [%team#1-nickname] would be relegated. [BRK_LN] Despite some good recent performances, [%team#1-short] have just not been good enough to overcome their [%number#2]-point deduction and it would surely now take a miracle for them to survive the drop.
KEY-392649: As the top teams start the run-in for the title, it seems unbelievable that [%team#1-short] - after a points deduction no less - are maintaining an unexpected position where they could qualify for continental football. [BRK_LN] It remains to be seen though whether they can continue their recent form and cement qualification.
KEY-392650: At the mid-point of the season and with the team performing above all expectations following a points deduction, [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans are now starting to believe they can maintain their position amongst the more likely promotion candidates.
KEY-392651: At the mid-way stage of the season, [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] position at the top end of the table was starting to look very fragile after a long run without a win. [BRK_LN] Finally however, the players have collected their win bonus and managed to slightly allay their anxious fans' fears of a slide down the league further impacted by their points deduction.
KEY-392652: At the other end of the pitch playing [%string#2] seemed to cause most problems, producing a clear-cut chance every [%number#2] minutes.
KEY-392653: At the other end of the pitch, playing against [%string#2] seemed to cause most problems, conceding a clear-cut chance every [%number#2] minutes.
KEY-392654: At the season's outset, [%team#1-nickname] were tipped to struggle following a points deduction and, until the recent victory, they seemed destined to drop down the table.
KEY-392655: At the start of the season, [%team#1-short] aim was to avoid relegation, particularly after a points deduction. [BRK_LN] Now at the mid-point of the season, the team are still in the mix for the title despite a poor recent run.
KEY-392659: Before the season kicked off, most expectations were that [%team#1-nickname] would need to work hard to avoid relegation, particularly following a points deduction. [BRK_LN] With the season nearly over, the club find themselves sitting comfortably in mid-table and this defeat should not worry them too much.
KEY-392660: Before the season, the bookmakers suggested [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] would be amongst the favourites for relegation, particularly in the light of their points deduction, but although the club see themselves in the drop zone, the way the team are playing may suggest they are capable of surviving.

KEY-392678: Dreams of a title challenge this season may be unrealistic for a side tipped to struggle after a points deduction but currently close to the top.

KEY-392683: Early season form counts for nothing in the long run and though [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] are clinging to their place at the top end of the table, this recent form suggests more difficult times ahead for a side hit with a points deduction earlier in the campaign.
KEY-392684: Early season performances mean that [%team#1-short] fans find their team sitting in mid-table, comfortably above the relegation struggle they were expected to be part of in the wake of a points deduction.
KEY-392685: Elsewhere, [%team#1-short] and [%team#3-short] celebrated their promotion to the [%comp#2-short] following [%scoreline#2-long_no_comp] and [%scoreline#3-long_no_comp].
KEY-392686: Even at this early stage of the season [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans look resigned to relegation. [BRK_LN] Unless a miracle happens and they can turn their form around, they appear destined to remain in their current relegation spot, a situation not at all helped by their points deduction.
KEY-392687: Even at this early stage of the season, [%team#1-short] sit as expected on the fringe of the relegation places following a points deduction. [BRK_LN] After a disappointing run of results this recent victory has given fans hope.
KEY-392688: Fans are hoping the end of [%team#1-nickname] unbeaten run will not signal the prospect of a slip down the table. [BRK_LN] Until their recent defeat, the team were hoping to confound critics in the wake of their points deduction and show they are better than relegation strugglers.
KEY-392689: Fans banned from [%team#1-short] vs [%team#2-short]
KEY-392696: Few [%team#1-short] fans really anticipate their side maintaining their lofty position in the league but with their recent poor run coming to an end with this worthy victory, at least they currently hang on to a position which would qualify for continental football next season, an outstanding feat considering they were hit with a points deduction.
KEY-392697: Few eyebrows have been raised by the way [%team#1-nickname] have started the season. [BRK_LN] The relegation favourites are currently at the bottom end of the table with [%number#2]-point deduction hardly aiding their cause and, although they've started stringing some results together recently, it looks set to be a long, hard season for them.
KEY-392698: Few eyebrows have been raised by the way [%team#1-nickname] have started the season. [BRK_LN] The relegation favourites are currently at the wrong end of the table with [%number#2]-point deduction hardly aiding their cause and, although they've started stringing some results together recently, it looks set to be a long, hard season for them.
KEY-392700: Following a good run of results and sitting in mid-table, [%team#1-short] recent defeat has concerned the fans. [BRK_LN] They now fear the worst and believe pundits' predictions of a struggle this season, especially after their points deduction.

KEY-392706: Half way through the season, and [%team#1] find themselves in a solid top-half position with memories of their [%number#2]-point deduction fading fast.

KEY-392707: Half way through the season, and [%team#1] find themselves sitting alongside teams at the top of the division with memories of their [%number#2]-point deduction fading fast. [BRK_LN] Despite being many peoples' favourites for the drop, [%team#1-nickname] picked themselves up quickly and have ruffled more than a few feathers in their unlikely ascent.
KEY-392708: Halfway through the season and the majority viewpoint amongst pundits seems to be that [%team#1-short] are still overachieving after their points deduction. [BRK_LN] Fans on the terraces however, think if they keep playing well they can give anybody a run for their money and challenge for the title.
KEY-392709: Hdr
KEY-392710: However, all but the real die-hard fans of [%team#1-short] expect their early good form to peter out and for the team to be unable to maintain a challenge for the title, particularly following their points deduction.
KEY-392711: Hwn
KEY-392712: If [%team#1-short] can continue their current form through the long season ahead, they may manage to confound the critics who said they would struggle after their points deduction. [BRK_LN] Rewarding their fans with qualification for continental competition next season would of course be an added bonus.
KEY-392714: In one of the biggest surprises in recent history, [%team#1] find themselves at the top end of the league as we enter the final few weeks. [BRK_LN] Many fancied [%team#1] for relegation, particularly after being hit with [%number#1]-point deduction but, after a season in which they have played brilliantly, they now look like serious championship contenders.
KEY-392715: In one of the biggest surprises in recent history, [%team#1] find themselves at the top end of the league as we enter the final few weeks.

[BRK_LN] Many fancied [%team#1] for relegation, particularly after being hit with [%number#1]-point deduction but, after a season in which they have played brilliantly, they now look like serious contenders for continental qualification.
KEY-392717: In one of the biggest surprises in recent history, [%team#1] find themselves sitting pretty at the top end of the league as we enter the final few weeks. [BRK_LN] Many fancied [%team#1] for relegation, particularly after being hit with [%number#1]-point deduction but, after a season in which they have played brilliantly, they have made many pundits eat their words.
KEY-392718: In order to aid with the transition, [%person#3], the club's [%job#3], would like to hold a meeting with you. Normally the board would hold a formal introduction with you, but due to the ongoing nature of the takeover, they do not have the requisite time. They would, however, like to wish you the best.
KEY-392720: In order to help you get started on making adjustments during the upcoming transfer window [%job#5] [%person#5] has taken the time to put together a list of potentially suitable signings.
KEY-392721: In the pre-season build up, [%team#1-short] were expected to struggle and, following a points deduction, it is therefore all the more amazing that they now find themselves in with a good chance of qualifying for continental competition. [BRK_LN] Their recent win has brought a bad run to an end and leaves them with an excellent chance in the run-in.
KEY-392722: In their only match played [%team#1] faced [%number#1] different formations, their most commonly faced tactic was [%string#1] which they played against for the vast majority of the match.

KEY-392729: In total [%team#1] created [%number#1] clear-cut chances and faced [%number#2] during this spell.
KEY-392734: It now seems a foregone conclusion that [%team#1-short] will feel the effects of their points deduction and eventually miss out on continental football. [BRK_LN] Although in a position to qualify at the moment, the team are now playing like the lower-half team everyone expected them to be.
KEY-392735: It remains to be seen whether [%team#1-short] can complete a miraculous season with a title victory. [BRK_LN] Against all predictions after a points deduction, the team are still riding high and even the end of an unbeaten run hasn't killed off their challenge yet.
KEY-392736: It's a marathon not a sprint though and this old adage must be on the minds of all but the most foolhardy [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans as they reflect on their team's top spot following [%number#2]-point deduction. [BRK_LN] Despite the club's excellent current form, most pundits still expect them to finish in the bottom half of the table.
KEY-392737: Just as [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] form had started to suggest they could battle out of the relegation places following their points deduction, the team suffer another disappointing defeat.
KEY-392739: MLS Guaranteed Contract Clause
KEY-392740: MLS Guaranteed Contract Clause
KEY-392741: Maybe the [%team#1-short] players are starting to believe the critics who say they are overachieving after a points deduction. Although they still find themselves flying high in the league their current form may suggest a bottom-half finish.
KEY-392742: Mid-way through the season and against all expectations after a points deduction, [%team#1-short] find themselves near the top. [BRK_LN] The prospect of an unlikely title challenge may have taken a knock with their recent defeat, but fans still seem optimistic that this immensely enjoyable season will have an incredible ending.
KEY-392743: Never in their wildest dreams for this season did {upper}[%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans expect to be riding high in a promotion chase with the season drawing to a close. [BRK_LN] It's now just a matter of keeping their current form going and next season they'll be playing in a higher league, a remarkable feat when taking into account their points deduction.
KEY-392744: New [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] arrivals to be unveiled by [%person#1-surname]
KEY-392745: New arrival [%male#3] must be wondering what he signed up for as short-tempered manager [%person#1] sensationally stormed out of a press conference intended to announce his arrival.
KEY-392746: New arrivals [%person_list#1] must be wondering what they've signed up for as short-tempered manager [%person#1] sensationally stormed out of a press conference intended to announce their arrivals.
KEY-392749: Nobody gives the team the slightest chance of maintaining a challenge for the title however. [BRK_LN] Early form got them close to the leaders despite a points deduction, but performances since suggest they will soon fall off the pace required.
KEY-392751: Normally upon appointment the board would take the time to introduce itself and meet you in person. However, due to the ongoing nature of the board's takeover, they won't have time to hold a formal introduction, but wish you the best.
KEY-392752: Not many would have predicted that, come the final third of the season, [%team#1] would be sitting in the top half of the table. [BRK_LN] Having been favourites for the drop following [%number#2]-point deduction, most pundits had predicted a fight to avoid relegation, but recent performances have been top class and a top half finish is now the least they deserve.
KEY-392753: Not many would have predicted that, come the final third of the season, [%team#1] would be sitting pretty in mid-table. [BRK_LN] Having been favourites for the drop following [%number#2]-point deduction, most pundits had predicted a fight to avoid relegation, but recent performances have been top class and a respectable finish is now the least they deserve.
KEY-392754: On a further note, [%team#1-nickname] have the [%number#1-nth] best average attendance in the [%fixture_name#1-comp_only] at the moment.
KEY-392768: Pundits now feel [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] will be condemned to struggle in the lower reaches of the table following a defeat which sees the end of their recent good form and brings back painful memories regarding the impact of their points deduction.
KEY-392769: Recent performances suggest [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] are unlikely to remain in the division's upper echelons for long. [BRK_LN] Early season predictions were for a struggle at the bottom following a points deduction and this now seems to be on the cards.
KEY-392770: Shortly after arriving, [%person#2] has taken the time to recommend a couple of players to keep an eye on from his previous club.
KEY-392771: Shortly after arriving, [%person#2] has taken the time to recommend a player to keep an eye on from his previous club.
KEY-392773: Some may be asking whether this is the start of the end for [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] unlikely promotion challenge. [BRK_LN] Though the team have been playing well in the wake of their points deduction, their recent defeat has had the critics doubting a promotion place can be maintained.
KEY-392779: Struggling [%team#1-short] continue to let down their fans who now fear that they may be dragged deeper into the relegation battle in the wake of their points deduction.
KEY-392785: The board considered the possibility of releasing an existing staff member in the same role to make room, but came to the conclusion that this would not be in the club's best interest at this time.
KEY-392786: The board have postponed the proposed transfer of [%person#1] due to staffing limits at the club. However, they are willing to allow you to release a staff member operating in the same role in order to complete the transfer.

KEY-392791: The maximum total pay-out to fans who bought tickets at [%stadium#1] would be over [%cash#1], [%media_source#1] understands.
KEY-392792: The pre-season forecast was for [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] to be relegated swiftly and their current position indeed reflects both that expectation and their points deduction. [BRK_LN] Their recent form however suggests, even with games running out, that the side are capable of picking up crucial points.
KEY-392794: The season has already been better than expected for [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans, particularly following their points deduction, but the end of their unbeaten run probably ends their dreams of climbing higher.

[BRK_LN] In this window clubs are able to replace long-term injured players with others playing in the same (or a similar) position. Player replacements must be free agents or signed from a domestic club.
KEY-392800: The victory is all the more impressive given the [%number#1] points [%team#1-short] were deducted this season.
KEY-392801: There's a long way to go this season, but [%team#1-short] must be happy with mid-table comfort following a points deduction and predictions they would struggle. [BRK_LN] Having shown good early form, results haven't gone well recently but this victory now has the fans a little more optimistic.
KEY-392806: This is [%person#1-surname] first role back in [%nation#1] since leaving [%team#1-short] rivals [%team#3-short] as [%job#3] in [%date#1-month_year].
KEY-392808: This much-needed victory has given [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans a glimmer of hope that their early season form, which came off the back of a points deduction yet still sees them in the promotion hunt, could be reviving. [BRK_LN] After a string of results without a win, pundits had started to suggest the club were more likely to be battling against relegation rather than contemplating a step up.
KEY-392809: This much-needed win has helped [%team#1-short] consolidate their place in mid-table, but critics still believe the team are overachieving and, with a points deduction having already hit them hard, are likely to struggle in the long term.
KEY-392810: This recent run of poor performances has left [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] desperately trying to hang on to their position at the top end of the league. [BRK_LN] Against expectations and in the wake of a points deduction, they managed to climb to dizzy heights but now appear to be foundering.
KEY-392811: This recent run of poor results suggests [%team#1-short] mid-table position may not accurately reflect their ability. [BRK_LN] Unless they can turn things around, they may well end up amongst the teams facing relegation worries, with their points deduction hardly having aided their cause.
KEY-392813: This {upper}[%team#1-nickname] defeat has brought to an end their recent unbeaten run and may signal the beginning of the end, say critics. [BRK_LN] The decline had first been predicted by pundits prior to the season and, reinforced by a points deduction, they will be happy their forecasts are being proved right.
KEY-392814: Though [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] sit in the top half at the moment, both their points deduction and their recent run suggest they may be fated to contest the places at the foot of the table.
KEY-392815: Though currently on the fringe of the relegation places [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] have recently been showing signs they could easily move to a more comfortable mid-table position, something that would amount to a fine achievement following their points deduction.
KEY-392816: Though just outside the relegation places, [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] prospects this season could be better than originally feared following their points deduction as the team continues to perform above expectations.
KEY-392817: Though the team sit in the relegation mire and are predicted to struggle, their recent victory has some of the fans craving for a continued upturn in fortunes and an unlikely recovery from their points deduction.
KEY-392818: Thr
KEY-392820: Title outsiders [%team#1-short] prospects of winning the title have taken a denting with poor results of late. [BRK_LN] The club, expected to struggle this season, has far exceeded the dreams of their fans, but now appear to be dropping off the pace.
KEY-392821: Twn
KEY-392849: With fixtures running out, [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans seem half resigned to slipping into the lower half of the table following a points deduction and this recent poor run of results.
KEY-392850: With half the season behind them, [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans are pleased to see their side sitting comfortably - well away from the division's strugglers. [BRK_LN] The team were tipped to toil at the bottom but their current form should keep them out of trouble, an impressive achievement following their points deduction.
KEY-392851: With half the season gone, [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] are now beginning to convince the public that, against all expectations and in the wake of their points deduction, this could indeed be a successful season.
KEY-392852: With half the season played, [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] unexpected promotion challenge has started to falter. [BRK_LN] Though the team still find themselves in a good position following a points deduction, their current form suggests that the second half of the season may be more of a struggle.
KEY-392853: With most people expecting a struggle at the bottom of the league following their points deduction, the team find their performances meriting a position in the top half.
KEY-392854: With opportunities for the chasing clubs running out, [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] have still managed to keep ahead of the pack. [BRK_LN] Their recent run of form however makes it highly likely they may be overtaken in a season which has already far exceeded the fans' expectations, particularly following their points deduction.
KEY-392855: With so little of the season remaining, [%team#1-short] fans remain uncertain of the team's future. [BRK_LN] Though sitting outside the relegation places after their points deduction, their current form isn't going to keep them safe much longer.
KEY-392856: With the club expected to struggle this season after a points deduction, [%team#1-nickname] early form, although slightly dented by this defeat, leaves them contemplating continental football at the moment.
KEY-392857: With the draw pitting a semi-pro outfit at home to a bigger team in [%team#2-nickname], a bumper crowd and television audience is expected for what will undoubtedly be a fascinating and hard-fought tie.

KEY-392859: With the season almost over, [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] are going to blow their promotion chances if they don't get straight back to winning ways after this defeat. [BRK_LN] Until this loss, the club were showing signs of being able to push for an unlikely promotion, particularly in the wake of their points deduction, but now critics expect them to drop off the pace.
KEY-392860: With the season at the halfway stage, [%team#1-short] still show hope of qualifying for continental football against all expectations, particularly after a points deduction.
KEY-392861: With the season coming to an end, the team's recent isolated success probably won't help as they languish deep in relegation territory, affected at least in part by their points deduction.
KEY-392862: With the season drawing on, [%team#1-short] continue to struggle just above the relegation places. [BRK_LN] Their season has gone very much as expected after a points deduction but this win should go some way to keeping them clear of the drop.
KEY-392863: With the season drawing to a close and the team still playing well, [%team#1-short] can hopefully start to reflect on a job well done in reaching mid-table security, especially after a points deduction led to them being expected to feature amongst the candidates for relegation.
KEY-392864: With the season halfway through, [%team#1-short] sit a number of positions higher than expected following a points deduction and can look forward to at least mid-table comfort if they keep playing as well as they are.
KEY-392865: With the season nearing completion, [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] sit comfortably in the top half. [BRK_LN] After initially being tipped to struggle following a points deduction, it now appears that fans and players alike can start to relax.
KEY-392866: With their side in the relegation zone and having a poor time lately, [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans were becoming resigned to their fate, especially following their points deduction. [BRK_LN] However, this victory over [%team#2-nickname] has given them hope for the second half of the season ahead.
KEY-392867: With their team sitting perilously close to the relegation positions following a points deduction, [%team#1-nickname] fans are showing how relieved they are that their side's run of games without a victory has finally come to an end.
KEY-392868: With their team tipped to struggle after a points deduction, the club's poor current form and early season position just above the relegation zone has had {upper}[%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans fearing the worst. [BRK_LN] All they can see for the rest of the season is a long, hard battle for survival.
KEY-392869: With this first win for a while, [%team#1-short] still find themselves at the opposite end of the table to that predicted following a points deduction. [BRK_LN] If they can build on their recent win, which brought to an end a poor run, they could go all the way to the wire in their challenge for honours.
KEY-392870: With this result [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] stare relegation in the face. [BRK_LN] The team continue to toil in vain after their points deduction and with games running out look destined for the drop.
KEY-392871: With this result, {upper}[%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] improbable early season form - particularly following their points deduction - has come to an abrupt end. [BRK_LN] Though the team are up with the anticipated title challengers, this league defeat suggests a slide down the table may be on the cards.
KEY-392872: With time running out for [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] battle against relegation, the recent defeat comes as a major blow to their hopes. [BRK_LN] The luckless team, already hit with a points deduction, now appear destined for the drop.

KEY-392963: [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans had actually begun to ponder an improbable league success until this last game saw the end of their unbeaten run. [BRK_LN] The feeling is that the team have been overachieving for some time, particularly in the wake of their points deduction, and most now expect the team to struggle to stay up at the top.
KEY-392964: [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] have faltered with this result and, after a promising unbeaten run, still remain in an anticipated relegation berth in the wake of their points deduction.
KEY-392965: [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] were tipped to struggle this season following a points deduction and, until their recent win, they looked doomed to slip away from their position in the top half of the league.
KEY-392966: [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] early season form appears to have deserted them and recent performances are more indicative of them being involved, as anticipated and especially following their points deduction, in a struggle near the bottom.
KEY-392967: [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] early season form sees them sitting in the top half, confounding their critics' pre-season expectations surrounding their points deduction. [BRK_LN] The end of their recent unbeaten run has rung a few alarm bells, but panic should not have set in just yet.
KEY-392968: [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] good form has kept them amongst the promotion-chasers against all expectations and in spite of [%number#2]-point deduction. [BRK_LN] Though the management are playing down the early-season form, fans are now starting to dream of better things.
KEY-392969: [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] much-needed win finally brings an end to their poor run which finds them clinging to an improbable promotion dream. [BRK_LN] With half the season to go, they will have to consign their recent unconvincing form to history and use this win as a springboard for a concerted promotion effort, which would be a remarkable about-turn following their points deduction.
KEY-392970: [%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] victory has given fans renewed spirit. [BRK_LN] Until this win all the talk was of the expected struggle and the points deduction, but now hopes are high the team can maintain a place in the upper half of the table.
KEY-392972: [%team#1-short] fans banned from [%team#2-short] match
KEY-392974: [%team#1-short] must bounce back quickly after their recent unbeaten run came to an end in this last match.

KEY-392977: [%team#1-short] vs [%team#2-short] behind closed doors
KEY-392978: [%team#1-short] annual end of season awards ceremony took place at [%stadium#1] last night. Below is the summary of the night's award winners.
KEY-392979: [%team#1-short] form may well be starting to wobble and their latest defeat has forced the fans to fear their side has not got what it takes to hang onto a continental qualification place. [BRK_LN] Critics are harsher, saying that the club's initially positive response to a points deduction was bound to come to an end sooner or later.
KEY-392980: [%team#1-short] title challenge may have started to wane with this result. [BRK_LN] Fans' hopes had risen after the team brushed away early season predictions of a struggle following a points deduction, but recent form suggests their elevated league position may be more fragile than they had thought.
KEY-392981: [%team#1] created a clear-cut chance on average every [%number#1] minutes and did not have to deal with any clear-cut chances against them in this period.

KEY-392986: [%team#1] created clear-cut chances most frequently when playing against [%string#1], creating on average every [%number#1] minutes whilst also not facing a single one themselves.

KEY-392988: [%team#1] failed to create a clear-cut chance during this period but, when playing against [%string#1], faced one every [%number#1] minutes on average.
KEY-392990: [%team#1] players are to personally refund supporters who bought tickets from the club for the [%scoreline#1-winner_loser] hammering at [%team#2-short] on [%date#1-day].
KEY-392991: [%team#2-short] fans banned from travelling to [%stadium#1]
KEY-392992: [%team#2-short] have reached a compensation settlement with [%team#1-short] of [%cash#1-long] in order to complete the move.
KEY-392993: [%team#2-short] supporters are unfortunately banned from attending this match, with the fixture considerably poorer for their absent support and the atmosphere they create as a result.
KEY-392994: [%team#2-short] will be backed by a decent number of travelling supporters, with around [%number#2] fans expected at the [%number#3] capacity ground to follow the team away from home.
KEY-392995: [%team#2-short] will only be able to count on a low number of travelling supporters, with around [%number#2] fans expected at the [%number#3] capacity ground to follow the team away from home.
KEY-393012: {upper}[%player_description#1] [%male#1] told the official club website that the players felt they had badly let down the travelling support and wanted to pay them back for their loyalty.
KEY-393013: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] were expected to struggle following a points deduction, but with the season drawing to a close and the side finally ending their recent run without a win, it now looks like they may be able to hang on for a mid-table finish.
KEY-393014: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] fans are becoming apprehensive due to their points deduction and recent bad form. [BRK_LN] They still cling to a position which would provide them with continental football next season, but many doubt they can hold onto it for much longer.
KEY-393015: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] position at the bottom end of the table has come as little surprise, particularly in the wake of their [%number#2]-point deduction. [BRK_LN] Despite the team having played well in recent games, the pre-season relegation candidates still find themselves in trouble, although there is still hope and time to turn it round.
KEY-393016: {upper}[%team#1-nickname] position at the wrong end of the table has come as little surprise, particularly in the wake of their [%number#2]-point deduction. [BRK_LN] Despite the team having played well in recent games, the pre-season relegation candidates still find themselves in trouble, although there is still hope and time to turn it round.
KEY-393017: {upper}[%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans can still cling to their dreams of league success this season. [BRK_LN] With the season almost over, they continue to hunt the title and despite a points deduction and a recent poor run, this latest victory suggests they could actually hold on against all pre-season expectations.
KEY-393018: {upper}[%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] fans' dreams of staying at the top end of the table took a boost recently after finally getting back to winning ways. [BRK_LN] This has helped to alleviate their fears that the team's unexpected early season form in the wake of a points deduction was but a distant memory.
KEY-393019: {upper}[%team#1-nickname_no_the_english_only] aspirations to maintain top spot took a denting as this result ended their unbeaten run. [BRK_LN] If the fans had been unconvinced of the team's ability to sustain their post-points deduction form, they will now fear the prospect of a slide down the league.
KEY-393020: {upper}[%team#1-short] fans will be hoping this defeat is just a blip in form and that they can get back to picking up sufficient points to keep them clear of relegation, particularly having already been hit by a deduction.
KEY-393021: {upper}[%team#1-short] reverse brings to an end their recent run which finds them sitting just above the relegation places. [BRK_LN] Fans now hope the club, who were hit with a points deduction earlier in the season, aren't going to slip into the drop zone.

KEY-401911: Despite only having [%number#1]% possession you've still managed to win. Did you intend to allow [%team#2-short] quite so much of the ball?
KEY-401922: The only statistic that matters here is that we scored more goals than they did
KEY-401923: When you've got attacking players with pace like we've got, it makes sense to try and play on the counter attack if possible and it's worked for us today
KEY-401924: It's a style that suits us more often than not and it happened to be one of those games today where it worked very nicely for us
KEY-401925: We like to play fast, incisive football and what you saw out there was how good we can be at times
KEY-401926: Not at all. I'd have liked us to have shown a bit more quality on the ball but we just couldn't manage it today. A win's a win though, however scrappy they come
KEY-401927: It's nice to win but it's not an entirely sustainable model to build a playing style around and we'll need to strike a better balance going forward
KEY-401928: I'd probably rather have seen more of the ball in order to be able to control the game a bit better in truth
KEY-401929: [%team#2-short] failed to register a single shot on target today. Is that a reflection of your complete dominance today?
KEY-401930: You prevented [%team#2-short] from mustering so much as a single shot on target. Does that perhaps show just how dominant you were here?
KEY-401931: That looked to be a superb defensive performance with not one shot on goal allowed. Your must be pleased with that level of performance?
KEY-401937: Our performance was complete; we played well in all phases of the game and fully deserved the win
KEY-401939: We played perfectly and now the next step is to do the same thing on a consistent basis
KEY-401940: We can be pleased with our defensive performance today for sure. It's not often that our goalkeeper will have very little to do so I'm sure he's pleased too!
KEY-401941: We looked very solid at the back and that laid the foundation for the rest of our performance
KEY-401942: I'm very happy with our defensive play; we had a good shape, good organisation and we were decisive in every way
KEY-401943: I wouldn't say it was completely dominant, we defended well but I wasn't pleased with some aspects of our general play
KEY-401944: It wasn't perfect and we won't be able to do that to every team; [%team#2-short] weren't up to their usual standards and they'd be the first to admit thatd
KEY-401945: It was a good performance but not a great one; we can certainly find ways in which to improve
KEY-401947: I think we got lucky and the story might've been very different on another day
KEY-401948: I'm actually not too pleased, [%team#2-short] weren't at the races but we didn't take full advantage of that and we played some sloppy stuff
KEY-401949: You must be disappointed to lose but is there even more frustration at the fact your side failed to register so much as a shot on target today?
KEY-401950: Your disappointment in defeat must surely be compounded by the fact that your side failed to register a single shot on target?
KEY-401951: How disappointed are you after a defeat in which your team failed to work the opposition goalkeeper even once?
KEY-401955: [%person#1-surname] embarrassed by goal-shy [%team#1-short]
KEY-401962: That won't happen very often, we did enough to give me confidence about the overall direction of the team
KEY-401963: Our attacking play was simply not good enough. For players of their quality to be shut out like that is unacceptable
KEY-401964: Credit to [%team#2-short] for defending very well but we weren't very good at all
KEY-401965: We didn't play anywhere near our best and that showed in our toothless attacking showing
KEY-401966: It's embarrassing for me as a coach and for them as players. I've told them in no uncertain terms how poor they were
KEY-401968: We're going to have to go back to the training ground and work much harder to ensure that sort of thing doesn't ever happen again
KEY-401969: You were under significant pressure for much of the match and were heavily out-shot yet you've come away with a result. How do you reflect on that performance?
KEY-401970: Despite being under the cosh for much of the game, and conceding a number of efforts on goal, you've come away with a result. Are you pleased with the outcome?
KEY-401971: Well, despite being comprehensively out-shot you've managed to avoid defeat. How do you reflect on that performance?
KEY-401975: [%person#1-surname] lambasts players after 'lazy' display
KEY-401976: I don't have too many clear thoughts right now as it was quite an intense match to watch. We'll have to analyse the footage and see what we make of it as a collective coaching staff
KEY-401977: I actually thought we played pretty well, especially at the back, and I'm pleased with the result
KEY-401978: We defended well and were good value for what we got from the game
KEY-401979: I'm happy with how we played overall and thought the result reflected our performance
KEY-401980: I think we deserved something from the match. We were certainly lucky at times but we earned that luck
KEY-401981: We needed a bit of luck here and there but, on the whole, we did well
KEY-401982: If you look past the shots, few of which actually threatened our goal, then I think we just about edged it
KEY-401983: We were a long way shy of our best and that showed in the way we were dominated. I can't be pleased with that performance
KEY-401984: We made it far too easy for [%team#2-short] and our performance wasn't up to scratch
KEY-401986: That was an extremely below-par display; we've been bailed out by one or two players who can hold their heads high plus a ton of luck
KEY-401987: On another day we'd have been on the wrong end of a hiding and it's now up to us to make sure that doesn't happen
KEY-401988: We got very, very lucky. Only a couple of our players even came close to playing to an acceptable standard and that's not good enough
KEY-401989: You were under significant pressure for much of the match and were heavily out-possessed yet you've come away with a result. How do you reflect on that performance?
KEY-401990: Despite being under the cosh for much of the game, and conceded plenty of possession, you've come away with a result. Are you pleased with the outcome?
KEY-401991: Well, despite being comprehensively out-possessed you've managed to avoid defeat. How do you reflect on that performance?
KEY-401992: I actually thought we played pretty well as a team. We were happy to concede possession knowing they'd struggle to use it to good effect
KEY-401993: They had a lot of the ball but we made sure they couldn't do anything with it
KEY-401994: We worked hard on our defensive structure in the build-up to the match and it certainly paid off
KEY-401995: I think we deserved something from the match. Our tactical focus and organisation was excellent
KEY-401996: We were very good value for something today; it doesn't matter how much possession you have if it doesn't lead to anything
KEY-401997: I'm pleased with how hard we made it for [%team#2-short] to take advantage of their superiority
KEY-401998: We're going to have to buck up our ideas sharpish if we want to achieve our goals this season. That wasn't good enough
KEY-401999: We weren't sharp enough and we were too cautious when we managed to get hold of the ball. It was wholly disappointing
KEY-402000: That was an extremely below-par display and we were lucky that [%team#2-short] didn't use the ball as well as they could have
KEY-402001: I'm sure [%team#2-short] are sat there wondering how they didn't win that. They certainly deserved to, we were rubbish
KEY-402002: We got very lucky today and could easily have been given a bit of a battering if things had gone a little differently
KEY-402003: You appeared to change formation whilst ahead only for it to seemingly come back to haunt you come full time. How do you explain that?
KEY-402004: A change of formation looks to have cost you a win there. What happened?
KEY-402005: Can you explain the change of formation that appeared to change the game very much against your side?
KEY-402010: That's football at the end of the day. If I'd have sat there and done nothing yet still dropped points, your question would be about that instead
KEY-402011: I made a decision that I believed would benefit the team at the time. Sometimes it doesn't work out but I maintain that it was what we needed there and then
KEY-402012: I saw something that I felt needed adjusting and, today at least, it didn't pay off
KEY-402013: I felt it suited us at that point in the game and I stand by it; that alone wasn't why we failed to hold onto our lead
KEY-402014: I just think we were a bit unlucky, it was nothing to do with tactics or anything like that
KEY-402015: Tactics have nothing to do with it, we didn't have the luck we needed
KEY-402016: I stand by the decision, things just went against us in the end
KEY-402017: It was one of those where I wasn't quite sure whether or not to make an adjustment and, given how things went, I probably shouldn't have
KEY-402018: In hindsight I think I was too eager and should've been more considerate about the implications of the change
KEY-402019: I'm going to get it wrong from time to time although today was one of my more egregious errors
KEY-402020: That one's on me, I got it wrong
KEY-402021: I'm to blame and I've told the players that much
KEY-402022: That one's on my shoulders; it was solely my call and I have to live with the result
KEY-402023: That was something of a managerial master stroke from you today, making a change to your formation and going on to turn things around. You must be delighted?
KEY-402024: You must be pleased with that tactical adjustment to turn the game in your favour?
KEY-402025: A change of tactic appears to have worked wonders for you today, turning a defeat into a victory. You must be pleased?
KEY-402030: It's never about one person, we're a team and we won today because we worked together
KEY-402031: I'm very happy, yes. That's why we play all ninety minutes
KEY-402032: I'm very happy, we made it count at a crucial time in the game
KEY-402033: I think it went perfectly to plan, the players knew how to adapt and were able to make an impact when we needed it
KEY-402034: I was very happy that it paid off; I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a risk but we had to gamble at that stage
KEY-402035: It came at a time where we had to gamble and it worked. I can't complain!
KEY-402036: I'm very pleased with how it all came together. Full credit to the players for adjusting so readily
KEY-402037: The players deserve all of the credit. I can only ask them to do something, they're the ones who have to go out there and make it happen and they did that today
KEY-402038: We'd worked on a few scenarios in training and the team deserve all of the credit for taking it on board and being ready to change when required
KEY-402039: I'm fortunate to work with a versatile and committed group of players who got the job done when questions were being asked of them
KEY-402040: There was more than an element of luck to it but we'll take that all day long
KEY-402042: Things turned in our favour but I can't say it wasn't without a little bit of luck
KEY-402043: That was something of a managerial master stroke from you today, bringing [%male#2] on as a substitute and reaping an almost-immediate reward. You must be delighted?
KEY-402044: You must be delighted with the impact [%male#2] made from the bench today?
KEY-402045: The introduction of [%male#2] as a substitute clearly changed the game. You must be delighted?
KEY-402046: [%person#1-surname] delighted with [%male#2-surname] impact
KEY-402049: It was a pleasing moment for sure but just one of a number from the match we have to go away and analyse in order to keep on improving
KEY-402050: I'm very happy, yes. He was in my ear all match asking to get on and, credit to the lad, he's made an impact
KEY-402051: Of course I'm pleased; [%male#2-first] is always capable of doing something like that and full credit to him
KEY-402052: He's done well, I knew he wanted to be on earlier than that and now he's given me a problem for the next match
KEY-402053: I'm very pleased with how it all came together, he's shown an incredible appetite to make an impact
KEY-402054: [%male#2-first] deserves the credit. He had the pressure on him to create a spark for us and he certainly did that
KEY-402055: I told him before he came on that he had an opportunity to make a difference and he's done exactly that
KEY-402056: He knew what we needed at that time in the game and to do that so quickly after coming on is testament to his character
KEY-402057: Your team scored an extremely late but crucial goal today, were you surprised that so much stoppage time was added?
KEY-402058: Do you have anything to say about the amount of stoppage time added, allowing your team to score a decisive late goal?
KEY-402059: There was plenty of stoppage-time drama here; did you expect quite so much to be added on?
KEY-402060: [%person#1-surname] praises officials after late goal
KEY-402061: [%person#1-surname] believes stoppage time was correct
KEY-402062: [%person#1-surname] unsure after scoring in added time
KEY-402063: [%person#1-surname] admits [%team#1-short] were lucky after late escape
KEY-402064: You'll have to ask the referee about that, it's none of my business
KEY-402065: The officials were absolutely correct to play that much more time. Go back and look at the stoppages and you'll see it clearly added up
KEY-402066: I was keeping time too and they got it spot on
KEY-402067: If anything there should've been even more time added on, but the officials did well under some pressure today
KEY-402068: I wasn't keeping an accurate check but the second half was a very stop-start affair and I certainly expected a fair bit of stoppage time
KEY-402069: I couldn't say for sure as I was too focused on the play itself but there were a couple of lengthy stoppages
KEY-402070: It seemed about right, I don't think [%team#2-short] can have any complaints
KEY-402071: I'm not sure to be honest, although it did seem to drag on an awful long time when it came to it
KEY-402072: I don't know but [%team#2-short] probably have reason to feel hard-done-by
KEY-402073: It did seem a tad excessive but we'll take it
KEY-402074: I probably wouldn't be too happy if the shoe was on the other foot, we got a bit lucky there
KEY-402075: I wouldn't have been happy had we conceded at that stage so I can empathise with [%team#2-short]
KEY-402076: I don't know where they got that amount of time from. We benefitted today but it didn't seem right
KEY-402077: Your team conceded an extremely late goal today to cost you a result, were you surprised that so much stoppage time was added?
KEY-402078: Do you have anything to say about the amount of stoppage time added, costing your team a result in the process?
KEY-402079: [%person#1-surname] 'livid' after conceding late goal
KEY-402080: [%person#1-surname] unhappy after conceding in added time
KEY-402081: I'm not prepared to risk a reprimand so I'll refrain from commenting right now
KEY-402082: I'm livid, they've conjured a number out of thin air and it's cost us dearly
KEY-402083: It's an absolute travesty, there was no justification for that much time and we've been robbed
KEY-402084: Is anybody really surprised at another officiating mistake? It's beyond a joke now
KEY-402085: I don't think it adds up at all but it's nothing new for referees to be making things up as they go along, is it?
KEY-402086: I can't see how they came about that number but, hey, it's not the first time it's cost us and nor will it be the last
KEY-402087: I think even the staunchest of [%team#2-short] supporters will admit they've stolen one there and that says it all
KEY-402088: I didn't get a good feeling for how much time there should have been but it seemed right and we were sloppy at the end
KEY-402089: I can't concern myself with that when we failed to see the game out. We have to focus on correcting our own mistakes first
KEY-402090: Regardless of how much time there should've been added, we weren't good enough at that stage of the game
KEY-402091: I think they got it right and we've only got ourselves to blame
KEY-402093: It seemed fair enough, we just have to do a better job of seeing the game out
KEY-402094: You opted against making a substitution today despite losing. What was your thinking behind that?
KEY-402095: You lost and chose not to make any substitutions. Can you maybe explain that to the supporters?
KEY-402096: Many people will wonder why you decided not to make any substitutions despite losing today. Can you enlighten us further?
KEY-402097: [%person#1-surname] defends lack of substitutions
KEY-402099: [%person#1-surname] rues not making changes
KEY-402100: I felt the balance of the game was such that we were better off with the players we had out there
KEY-402101: I thought we were better off without making a change there and then
KEY-402102: I think the players out there at that stage were more likely to get us back into the game than any of the subs
KEY-402103: I felt we had a better chance to win with the players on the pitch at the time and that our substitutes weren't suited to this particular situation
KEY-402104: I don't think any of our substitutes were in a condition to change the game if I'm honest
KEY-402105: The team we had out there should have been good enough to turn things around
KEY-402106: It was one of those where I wasn't quite sure whether or not to make an adjustment and, given how things went, I probably should have
KEY-402107: We'll all learn from this defeat and perhaps I shouldn't be so cautious next time
KEY-402108: I don't often regret not doing something but today is one of those occasions where I think something should've been done
KEY-402109: You opted against bringing [%male#2] on as a sub today despite losing. What was your thinking behind that?
KEY-402110: You lost and chose not to bring [%male#2] on. Can you maybe explain that to the supporters?
KEY-402111: Many people will wonder why you decided not to use [%male#2] despite losing today. Can you enlighten us further?
KEY-402112: [%person#1-surname] defends lack of [%male#2-surname]
KEY-402114: My reasons for not using him are private and will remain so for the time being
KEY-402115: I think the players out there at that stage were more likely to get us back into the game than [%male#2-first] was
KEY-402116: I felt we had a better chance to win with the players on the pitch at the time and that [%male#2-first] wasn't suited to this particular situation
KEY-402117: I don't think he was in a condition to change the game if I'm honest
KEY-402118: How big of a moment was [%male#2] late miss that could have seen you take something from the game?
KEY-402119: What was your reaction to [%male#2] late miss that could have seen you take something from the game?
KEY-402120: Talk us through [%male#2] late miss that could have seen you take something from the game?
KEY-402121: [%person#1-surname]: We deserved something from [%team#2-short] match
KEY-402122: [%person#1-surname] takes positives from defeat
KEY-402124: [%person#1-surname] criticises [%male#2-surname] after late miss
KEY-402125: It was just one of hundreds of moments throughout the match, no more or no less significant than the rest
KEY-402126: It would've been nice for him to score it because I felt we were the better team and deserved something from the game
KEY-402127: I thought we were value for something from the match and that was the moment where it should've happened
KEY-402128: I can't place too much blame on him when the whole team were below par
KEY-402129: We'll take the positives from the match but the miss summed the day up for us, it just wasn't to be
KEY-402130: It wasn't a terrible performance and we can be happy with some aspects of our game but it was one of those days really
KEY-402132: He'll be the first to tell you he should've scored
KEY-402133: He knows he should've done better there
KEY-402134: He won't get too many better chances to score and he was the first to hold his hands up after the match
KEY-402135: I was expecting the net to bulge and, quite frankly, it's not good enough on his part
KEY-402136: I still can't believe he missed, I don't know how to explain it
KEY-402137: I was already off in celebration. How he's missed it I'll never know
KEY-402138: How big of a moment was [%male#2] late miss that could have seen you win the match?
KEY-402139: What was your reaction to [%male#2] late miss that could have seen you win the game?
KEY-402140: Talk us through [%male#2] late miss that could have seen you take win the game?
KEY-402142: [%person#1-surname] takes positives from draw
KEY-402143: It would've been nice for him to score it because I felt we were the better team and deserved to win
KEY-402144: I thought we were value for a win and that was the moment where it should've happened
KEY-402145: The match will, of course, be played in your home stadium of [%stadium#1]. How much of an advantage is that for the final?
KEY-402148: [%person#1-surname] dismisses [%stadium#1] advantage
KEY-402151: It reduces a lot of unnecessary worry for us. It's a venue we know well and our preparation will take that into account. It's the best thing we could have hoped for and it would be very special to win the trophy here too
KEY-402152: It's an advantage and they don't come around too often at this stage of competition. It's up to us to make the most if it
KEY-402153: I can't see it being too much of a factor; the place won't be quite as full of [%team#1-short] supporters and that alone will make it a very strange experience
KEY-402154: It could actually work against us; we'll have the pressure of winning in our own stadium to contend with alongside everything else a final brings
KEY-402155: The match will, of course, be played at [%team#2-short] [%stadium#2]. How are you preparing for that?
KEY-402157: [%person#1-surname] out to ruin [%team#2-short] big day
KEY-402159: [%person#1-surname] claims [%team#1-short] 'at disadvantage'
KEY-402160: It suits us down to the ground; it's just another stadium for us whereas it's a big deal for [%team#2-short]. The pressure is entirely on them
KEY-402161: It's a big day for both teams but it's a little bit bigger for them and we're intent on spoiling their party
KEY-402162: I'm not looking forward to it; they'll have the familiarity and the majority of the support. We're already up against it before a ball has even been kicked
KEY-402163: It's a disadvantage for sure. We'll have to be at our very best to tip the balance in our favour
KEY-402164: Can we expect mass changes for this one with the big match against [%team#3-short] around the corner?
KEY-402165: Are you considering rotating the squad with the [%team#3-short] match in mind?
KEY-402166: We all know how big that match is and, with all due respect to [%team#2-short], I will pick the team with the big picture in mind
KEY-402167: I have to treat every match as important but, yes, it would be wise to perhaps make one or two adjustments here
KEY-402168: I've got a talented and capable squad and, if changes are made here, then it's a fantastic moment for some of them to make my life even harder ahead of the [%team#3-short] match
KEY-402169: My coaching staff and I have thoroughly prepared for both matches and the team will be picked according to the needs and demands of each fixture
KEY-402170: I would never disrespect an opponent like that; I will be playing the strongest squad available to me
KEY-402171: We're taking things one match at a time and it would be disrespectful to [%team#2-short] to look beyond them at this point in time
KEY-402172: It would be foolish to look beyond [%team#2-short]; a positive result against [%team#3-short] will be meaningless if we fail to take maximum points here
KEY-402173: I don't want to talk about the [%team#3-short] match yet; there'll be plenty of time for that but for now our focus is solely on [%team#2-short]
KEY-402174: Will you be making changes with this match falling so close to the [%team#3-short] fixture?
KEY-402176: There will probably be one or two changes yes. I know I can rely on everybody in my squad
KEY-402177: I think it would be sensible, there are a few players not in ideal condition to play so soon after a match
KEY-402178: We'll see. Maybe this is a chance for a few players to make a stronger impression for a regular place
KEY-402179: We'll have to wait and see how certain players react between now and kick-off. There's a chance we'll have to make a few adjustments
KEY-402180: I don't think so; this is another challenging match that we'll need to be at our best for and that will require our best players to be involved once again
KEY-402181: [%team#2-short] are a very capable team and we would be wise not to overlook them
KEY-402182: We run a fantastic operation here; our medical department perform great work and the coaching team ensure the players are given sensible workloads. We shouldn't need to make changes
KEY-402183: The long-term fitness work done with the squad means we're able to handle multiple matches in a short period of time without having to make changes. I always prefer to play with my strongest team
KEY-402184: Will you be making changes with this match with [%team#2-short] arguably one of the easier games during this hectic schedule?
KEY-402185: Can we expect some rotation against [%team#2-short] considering the run of matches you're currently on?
KEY-402186: Rotation is 100% necessary when there's a run of fixtures like this otherwise players become far more susceptible to injury
KEY-402187: I think we have to; some of the lads won't make it through every one of our matches during this run otherwise
KEY-402188: With the [%comp#1-short] presumably some way down your list of priorities can we expect a more experimental line-up?
KEY-402189: Will you be looking to experiment in this competition? Some would say it's not exactly high on your list of priorities...
KEY-402190: It's our best opportunity to. Everyone needs to get minutes in their legs and it's also a good opportunity to look at one or two younger players
KEY-402191: It's a long season and everyone wants to play so from that perspective it's only right if we take a look at all of our options when conditions allow for it
KEY-402192: Without wanting to disrespect the competition, it's clear that at a club like ours there are certain requirements to fulfil elsewhere. If that means using a different group of players here then so be it
KEY-402193: We're aiming to be playing for as long as possible in as many competitions as possible. To ensure we stand a good chance of achieving our goals we need to make full use of our very talented and capable squad
KEY-402194: There might be a couple of changes but, make no mistake, we want to win this competition
KEY-402195: We respect every competition and we're aware that the supporters would love nothing more than another trophy. We'll give this match our utmost attention, just as we would any other
KEY-402196: I don't think we'll be fielding any sort of weakened team. I respect our opponents and the competition too much to do that
KEY-402197: I may make changes but I want to win and will pick a team capable of doing so
KEY-402198: It's not the best weather for football out there today; how do you think the conditions will affect your performance?
KEY-402199: [%person#1-surname] makes light of conditions
KEY-402203: I 99% of footballers aren't remotely bothered about the weather to be perfectly honest
KEY-402204: I don't think they're too bad; we're going to try to play our normal game and I'm confident we can do that
KEY-402205: My players can adapt to any situation; a little bit of weather isn't going to affect us
KEY-402206: It's certainly not ideal and we're going to have to make a few adjustments on-the-fly in an effort to deal with the situation
KEY-402207: I have to admit to being a little concerned; I don't know how we'll react as a team but it makes life a bit harder for sure
KEY-402208: Both teams come into this one in good form; how do you rate your chances ahead of kick-off?
KEY-402212: [%person#1-surname] fears defeat for [%team#1-short]
KEY-402214: I enjoy these matches a lot, the players don't need any extra motivation and they demand a high standard of football. I think we've got what it takes to win
KEY-402215: They're a very good team and we're going to relish the challenge of keeping our good form going whilst putting a dent in their aspirations
KEY-402216: We're going to have to be at our very best to get something today; [%team#2-short] are as good as they come and will certainly be able to cause us one or two problems
KEY-402217: I don't think we've played all that well despite our good run of form and, if we don't attain a high standard of football here, we could struggle
KEY-402218: You come into this one in good form whilst your opponents do not; do you perhaps fear complacency ahead of kick-off?
KEY-402220: Let's not be negative so close to the match; I think my players know what to do
KEY-402221: I don't have any concerns about that, we've prepared in a professional manner and will now go out and do our jobs
KEY-402222: It's a different sort of challenge for us today, we have to be focused on playing our game and being clinical in front of goal
KEY-402223: [%team#2-short] are a better team than their recent run of form might indicate and they're going to give us a really tough match here
KEY-402224: That's always in the back of my mind, yes. If we approach this game with anything less than 100% focus then we could quite easily come unstuck
KEY-402225: You come into this one having struggled a little of late whilst your opponents are riding the crest of a wave; do you anticipate another bad day at the office today?
KEY-402227: [%person#1-surname] fearing another disappointment
KEY-402228: It's hard to say really. If we play as well as I know we can then we can get a result
KEY-402229: Our bad luck has to end somewhere and I'm very hopeful it'll be today
KEY-402230: Well, it's going to be hard to get a result, but my players are always up for a challenge and we're looking forward to it
KEY-402231: We're up against a very good team and, clearly, we're not playing anywhere near our best. If things continue as they have been then it's going to be another tough ninety minutes
KEY-402232: It's easy to become disheartened by a poor run of form but it's also easy to see why we're right up against it here today too
KEY-402233: Both teams come into this one in a spell of poor form; is this therefore a good opportunity to step up and arrest your recent struggles?
KEY-402234: It's going to be very scrappy and almost certainly won't be pretty and the team that works hardest is going to emerge with their reward
KEY-402235: It's a great opportunity to shake off our malaise, find our focus and turn our form around
KEY-402236: We have to show that we want this more than they do. We're both in a similar predicament so we need to be up for the challenge
KEY-402237: If we don't step up our game and play at the level I know we can then perhaps it'll be [%team#2-short] celebrating come full time
KEY-402238: I'd love to be confident right now but, the way things have been going recently, it's not easy to think that way
KEY-402239: [%person#1-first], it's derby day. How much do you look forward to taking on your local rivals?
KEY-402245: It's always a tremendous occasion and the atmosphere is something to behold. Hopefully we can harness the energy and intensity of the day and send the fans home happy
KEY-402246: I personally always look forward to this one, there's been a real buzz around the training ground all week and now we get to go out there and try to put on a show

KEY-411753: We're interested in signing [%male#3], it would be great if you could have a word with the press about how good it is to have him playing for us.
KEY-411755: I really don't think I'm comfortable talking to the press on your behalf. If you want to sign him, then you should talk to the press yourself.
KEY-411756: Wouldn't you love playing and training alongside a player like him? I believe if you make an effort and talk to the press about him, this could make all the difference and might convince him to come and play for us.
KEY-411757: After speaking with [%male#3], I believe that the player is willing to give you more time to keep your promise to sell [%male#4] and understands that it hasn't been for a lack of trying so far.
KEY-411758: After speaking with [%male#3], I believe that the player is willing to give you more time to keep your promise to sign a replacement for [%male#4] and understands that it hasn't been for a lack of trying so far.

KEY-411761: After speaking with [%male#3], I believe that the player is willing to give you more time to keep your promise of reducing the size of the first team squad and recognises that you have been trying to find new homes for certain players.
KEY-411762: After speaking with [%male#3], I believe that the player is willing to give you more time to keep your promise of signing [%male#4] and appreciates that you have been trying to strike a deal.
KEY-411763: After speaking with [%male#3], I believe that the player is willing to give you more time to keep your promise of sending him out on loan and appreciates that you have been trying to strike a deal.
KEY-411764: After speaking with [%male#3], I believe that the player understands that his injury will affect exactly when you will be in a position to keep your promise of selling him.
KEY-411765: After speaking with [%male#3], I believe that the player understands that his injury will affect exactly when you will be in a position to keep your promise of giving him more first team football.
KEY-411766: After speaking with [%male#3], I believe that the player understands that his injury will affect exactly when you will be in a position to keep your promise of offering him a new contract.
KEY-411767: After speaking with [%male#3], I believe that the player understands that his injury will affect exactly when you will be in a position to keep your promise of sending him out on loan.
KEY-411768: After speaking with [%male#3], I believe that the player understands that his injury will affect exactly when you will be in a position to keep your promise of playing him in his favoured position.
KEY-411769: After speaking with [%male#3], I believe that the player appreciates that you have made a concerted attempt at strengthening the first team squad and as such is prepared to wait until the next transfer window before making a decision on his future at the club.
KEY-411770: After speaking with [%male#3], I believe that the player appreciates that you have made a concerted attempt to bring in a familiar face in order to help him settle and as such is prepared to wait until the next transfer window before making a decision on his future at the club.
KEY-411771: After speaking with [%male#3], I believe that the player appreciates that you have made a concerted attempt to bring in a familiar face, such as a friend or a former team-mate, in order to help him settle and as such is prepared to wait until the next transfer window before making a decision on his future at the club.
KEY-411772: After speaking with [%male#3], I believe that the player appreciates that you have made a number of signings to strengthen the first team squad but feels that the squad still isn't strong enough.
KEY-411773: Some critics have suggested that your training regimen is to blame for the current injury woes. How do you respond to those accusations?
KEY-411774: [%person#1-surname] to consider adjustments to training following injury problems
KEY-411776: [%person#1-surname] defends training schedule
KEY-411777: [%person#1-surname] hits out after criticism of training schedule
KEY-411778: I don't think it's worth any of my time responding to
KEY-411779: I think it's clear at this stage that something needs to be done to halt the problems. Whether that affects our day-to-day training I don't know yet but it'll certainly warrant a review
KEY-411780: We might be asking too much of some players and could possibly do a better job of tailoring each individual's workload. I'll be sitting down with the coaching staff to discuss how best to approach this
KEY-411781: I'm confident that our training programme is well-designed and thought out and that the current situation is just a freak circumstance. We don't need to go overboard here
KEY-411782: I'm not about to start taking advice on things from people who aren't remotely qualified to advise me on how to train my players
KEY-411783: There are also claims that [%number#1] players absent hardly constitutes a discussion of an injury crisis in the first place?
KEY-411788: Each to their own. I can't change someone's mind if they don't consider our situation to be particularly troublesome
KEY-411789: Crisis or no crisis, we have to get on with business, and one player's absence is another player's opportunity to step up and impress
KEY-411790: We're dealing with it. Some teams would consider it a crisis, others might not, but it's a situation we have to find a solution for
KEY-411791: I hardly see how there can be any argument that it's not a crisis when you take into account our lack of squad depth and upcoming schedule
KEY-411792: That's laughable, we're down to the bare bones here yet some will have you believe we're doing just fine!
KEY-411793: [%person#2] has recently been sacked from his role as [%job#2]. How do you expect things to develop going forward?
KEY-411794: I think it's a move we had to make for the good of the entire team and, hopefully, we can move towards a more positive long-term solution
KEY-411795: I wanted to go in a different direction and firmly believe everyone will be better off for the decision
KEY-411796: Regardless of the terms on which we parted, I'll miss him and so will the club. It's important to find a suitable replacement as soon as possible
KEY-411797: It's a role of huge importance and I'll certainly be contacting a couple of people with a view to bringing them in as replacements
KEY-411798: It's set to be the end of an era here following the announcement that you intend to step down as the hugely-successful manager of [%team#1-short]. Why is now the time for you to have made that decision?
KEY-411800: [%person#1-surname] [%team#1-short] stay draws to a close
KEY-411801: [%person#1-surname] lost passion for [%team#1-short] job
KEY-411803: I'm sure I'll be more forthcoming at some point down the line but, for the time being, I won't be going into specifics
KEY-411804: I've been thinking about this day for a long time; I've had long discussions with my family and several people here and it's time to take the next step in my life
KEY-411805: I think my stay is reaching a natural conclusion; it happens to every manager eventually and I'm lucky to have enjoyed such a long and fruitful tenure here
KEY-411806: Without wanting to go into too many details I don't have the same passion for the job now as I used to
KEY-411807: I've got different priorities now and a few different ambitions I'd like to realise before my time in the game is up
KEY-411808: You've brought tremendous success here in a relatively short period of time so, understandably, many are wondering why you intend to step down as manager of [%team#1-short]?
KEY-411811: [%person#1-surname]: [%team#1-short] no longer exciting
KEY-411812: [%person#1-surname] hints all was not well at [%team#1-short]
KEY-411813: I don't have a singular reason for wanting to move on, it's just something I want to do
KEY-411814: I want to experience everything football has to offer and staying in one place for a long time has never suited me very well. It's time for a new challenge
KEY-411815: I have ambitions, we all have ambitions. I've done everything I set out to achieve here and now somebody else can have a go
KEY-411816: There's no excitement when I come into work here now. That's not fair to myself or to the team so I'm ready to move on
KEY-411817: I can't go into too many specifics but this is a different job to the one I initially took and I don't have the same motivation for the task at hand
KEY-411818: It's set to be the end of an era here following the announcement that you intend to step down as the manager of [%team#1-short]. Will you ultimately look back with regret that you couldn't bring greater success?
KEY-411819: [%person#1-surname] admits [%team#1-short] regrets
KEY-411820: [%person#1-surname] wanted greater success
KEY-411821: [%person#1-surname] proud of [%team#1-short] work
KEY-411822: [%person#1-surname]: I've been a success
KEY-411823: I'll leave that up to you to decide. After all, the media always knows best
KEY-411824: I expect every manager will look back at their career wondering what might have been. I've had some good times and some bad times and, yes, a few regrets along the way here
KEY-411825: Success is earned, not bestowed, and we've ultimately not earned as much of it as everyone would've preferred. I've enjoyed every second of my time here though
KEY-411826: How do you define success? I think that when all is said and done my body of work will stand up to close scrutiny
KEY-411827: Absolutely not. I consider my tenure highly successful and that's all that matters
KEY-411828: With the news that you intend to step down as the manager of [%team#1-short] after, will you ultimately look back with regret that you couldn't bring greater success?
KEY-411829: I came here with a few targets in mind and, unfortunately, haven't been able to achieve them. That's football
KEY-411830: I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't have preferred to celebrate a little more often
KEY-411831: I don't know about that; I might not have stayed for a generation like some managers but I think I've done pretty well all in all
KEY-411832: What's next for [%person#1]? Do you still have the energy and drive to work in football?
KEY-411833: [%person#1-surname] ready for next challenge
KEY-411834: [%person#1-surname] 'still has something to offer'
KEY-411835: [%person#1-surname] looking to wind down career
KEY-411836: [%person#1-surname] edging towards retirement
KEY-411837: I've not decided yet. There'll be some time for my family and me to take stock of things and we'll go from there
KEY-411838: Oh definitely, I've got the passion and energy of a manager half my age. I'm not done yet
KEY-411839: I think I've still got something to offer the right club. I won't turn down any advances, put it that way
KEY-411840: At my age I think it's sensible to start winding things down a little. I'd be interested in carrying on in some capacity, be it international football or something else, for a while at least
KEY-411841: I wouldn't rule anything out but it would take a special offer to catch my eye now
KEY-411842: What's next for [%person#1]? What are your ambitions?
KEY-411843: [%person#1-surname] aiming for the top
KEY-411844: [%person#1-surname] looking for long-term challenge
KEY-411845: [%person#1-surname] seeking change of direction in career
KEY-411846: [%person#1-surname] uncertain about future
KEY-411847: I want to work at the very top level of the game and will be looking for the best opportunity to make that become a reality
KEY-411848: I'd ideally find a team that shares my outlook on football, somewhere I can build something that stands the test of time
KEY-411849: I'm thinking something different, something I might not have previously considered. I want to fall in love with football all over again
KEY-411850: I don't know for sure but I don't want to go straight back into a job like this one
KEY-411851: What effect do you think the timing of this announcement will have on the rest of the season?
KEY-411852: [%person#1-surname] aiming for the top
KEY-411853: [%person#1-surname] looking for long-term challenge
KEY-411854: [%person#1-surname] seeking change of direction in career
KEY-411855: [%person#1-surname] uncertain about future
KEY-411856: I don't know, it's a question for the players more than anything else
KEY-411857: I don't want it to become a distraction, we've got targets we want to achieve and our focus needs to be squarely on those
KEY-411858: Hopefully we can go back to normal, but I know that's not very likely, so we're going to have to manage things a little more closely
KEY-411859: I wanted to wait until the end of the season because I know this is going to dominate things for a while and that's not a good thing as far as I'm concerned
KEY-411860: I expect it'll be a little more of a circus than usual. Hopefully it doesn't affect us too badly
KEY-411861: [%male#2] has been playing very well whilst on loan at [%team#2-short]. How do you envisage his long-term development going?
KEY-411887: Not tremendously, no. Poor form is something every player has to deal with in their careers and we still believe in [%male#2-first] long-term potential
KEY-411888: I've not seen anything to worry about, it's just a bit of a dip for him, nothing more
KEY-411889: This is the reason we sent him on loan; if he was playing that way here, he wouldn't be in the team. It's a different story at [%team#2-short] though and the challenge facing him now is to find a way out of his funk
KEY-411891: Are you at all concerned by [%male#2] general lack of playing time whilst on loan at [%team#2-short]?
KEY-411904: [%person#1-surname] yet to decide on [%male#2-surname] future
KEY-411907: It's one avenue we could explore but ultimately we have to do what's best for [%male#2-first]
KEY-411908: I'm not sure, we have to go into this with a definitive plan for him otherwise his development will be adversely affected
KEY-411909: We've discussed a few options but it's not clear yet whether that'll be the way we go
KEY-411910: [%male#2] has been playing very well whilst on loan at [%team#2-short] in what must seem a stark contrast to your own struggles. Do you wish you had his services at your disposal?
KEY-411911: [%person#1-surname] wants [%male#2-surname] back
KEY-411912: [%person#1-surname] admits [%male#2-surname] could help out
KEY-411913: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] wouldn't solve our woes
KEY-411914: [%person#1-surname] suggests [%male#2-surname] is better off at [%team#2-short]
KEY-411915: We could do with a few more players in good form and he definitely fits the bill
KEY-411916: He could hardly do worse than a few of our current crop, that's for sure
KEY-411917: He's doing well but it's going to take a lot more than just him to help us turn our fortunes around
KEY-411918: I think he's better off where he is right now, it'd be of no benefit to him to be embroiled in our problems
KEY-411919: [%male#2] has caught the eye whilst on loan at [%team#2-short] following a tremendous hat-trick against [%team#3-short]. How do you envisage his long-term development going?
KEY-411920: [%male#2] has caught the eye whilst on loan at [%team#2-short] including a penalty save against [%team#3-short]. How do you envisage his long-term development going?
KEY-411921: [%male#2] has caught the eye whilst on loan at [%team#2-short] and has recently made his international debut for [%team#4-short]. How do you envisage his long-term development going?
KEY-411922: I'm really pleased to see him earning international honours, he's certainly on the right track
KEY-411923: [%male#2] has caught the eye whilst on loan at [%team#2-short] and has recently won the [%award#1]. How do you envisage his long-term development going?
KEY-411924: I'm happy to see him winning awards and earning recognition for his play. He's certainly on the right track
KEY-411925: [%male#2] is reportedly none too happy following claims that you have back-tracked on promises to give your players a chance to bounce back from relegation only to go out and make new signings. How do you respond?
KEY-411926: [%person#1-surname] building squad to bounce back from relegation
KEY-411927: [%person#1-surname] hopes for [%male#2-surname] support
KEY-411928: [%person#1-surname] wants promotion 'whatever it takes'
KEY-411929: [%person#1-surname] brushes aside [%male#2-surname] criticism
KEY-411930: This is an internal matter for the club and we'll be keeping it in-house for the time being
KEY-411931: I don't quite understand where he's coming from; if we're to go straight back up then we need to make improvements to the squad. He and everyone else will still get a chance to contribute but they have to prove that they're good enough
KEY-411932: I stand by that and new signings won't change a thing. I'm counting on his support just as much as anybody else in the squad
KEY-411933: I'll do whatever it takes to secure promotion this season. If [%male#2-first] isn't on board then I'm sure we can find somewhere else for him to play his football
KEY-411934: I'm really not too concerned about what he has to say; this is [%team#1], not [%male#2] FC.
KEY-411935: [%male#2] is reportedly worried following rumours that you intend to replace him in the [%team#1-short] squad with new signing [%male#3]. Can you assuage his concerns?
KEY-411936: [%person#1-surname] : [%male#2-surname] going nowhere
KEY-411938: [%person#1-surname] challenges [%male#2-surname] to prove worth
KEY-411939: [%person#1-surname] admits [%male#2-surname] could leave
KEY-411940: There's not really a story here is there? It's something over nothing and it's best for everyone concerned if we simply move on as if nothing was ever said
KEY-411941: I've no intention of selling him. [%male#3] brings a lot of quality to the squad but so does [%male#2-first] and I'm in the business of having as many quality players as I possibly can
KEY-411942: I'm counting on him to be an important player this season and, hopefully, he'll show that he's equally as committed
KEY-411943: The way I see it is that [%male#2-first] has to take this as an opportunity to step his game up and prove his worth to me. I pick players on merit and he has to show that he belongs as we strive to improve every facet of the club
KEY-411944: I don't know what his future holds right now. He could go, he could stay, but it's largely going to be up to him either way
KEY-411945: What is your response to the developing story that [%male#2] is unhappy at not being allowed to discuss terms with [%team#2-short] following [%team#1-short] relegation?
KEY-411948: He's [%team#1-short] player, there's no story here
KEY-411949: I've no intention of selling him. We hope to make an immediate return and he's going to be an important part of that
KEY-411950: I'm not in the business of catering to the whims of every player at this club. He signed a contract here and now it's time for him to honour his end of the deal
KEY-411951: I wouldn't rule out a move but, if it happens, it'll be on our terms not his
KEY-411952: What is your response to the developing story that [%male#2] wants to join [%team#2-short] following [%team#1-short] relegation?
KEY-411953: What is your response to the developing story that [%male#2] is unhappy at being priced out of a potential move to [%team#2-short] following [%team#1-short] relegation?
KEY-411954: There's something of a story going around that [%male#2] is apparently unhappy at the nature of your team talks and feels that you're perhaps a soft touch. Would you care to respond?
KEY-411956: [%person#1-surname] discusses team talks
KEY-411958: [%person#1-surname] hits out following [%male#2-surname] criticism
KEY-411959: Is there really nothing else of substance to ask? I despair at the state of journalism sometimes, I really do
KEY-411960: I've never shied away from the fact that I don't believe shouting at players achieves very much at all and, with respect to [%male#2-first], I don't think that'll change any time soon
KEY-411961: I think there's a time and a place for everything and I'll make sure my voice is heard when it needs to be, but I don't really understand [%male#2-first] issue here
KEY-411962: I don't think this is up for public debate really. The majority of the squad are apparently fine with the status quo so we'll leave it at that
KEY-411963: I'm disappointed that [%male#2-first] has felt the need to leak this out and have it become a story. I thought better of him
KEY-411964: There's something of a story going around that [%male#2] is apparently unhappy at the nature of your team talks and feels you were unduly harsh to [%male#3] recently. Would you care to respond?
KEY-411965: [%person#1-surname] admits to going over the top in team talk
KEY-411966: Things happen in the heat of the moment but, with the benefit of hindsight, I think the way I responded to [%male#3-first] was over the top and unnecessary. Hopefully we can all move forward in a positive manner now
KEY-411967: There's something of a story going around that [%male#2] is apparently unhappy at the nature of your team talks and feels that you were rather lenient when dealing with [%male#3] recently. Would you care to respond?
KEY-411968: There's something of a story going around that [%male#2] is apparently unhappy at the suggested confusing nature of your team talks. Would you care to respond?
KEY-411970: I like to think that I deliver coherent and well-considered points the majority of the time but if my players feel the message isn't getting across then I have to make sure a better job is done
KEY-411971: I don't really understand [%male#2-first] issue here; everyone else seems to have understood me
KEY-411972: Do you have any comments on the story that [%male#2] is unhappy at the lack of squad depth at [%team#1-short]; an issue he believes he has the support of several first-team players on?
KEY-411975: [%person#1-surname] defends squad depth concerns
KEY-411976: I have nothing to say right now other than to remind the fans that I am constantly appraising the balance of the squad
KEY-411977: I fully share their sentiment and can assure everybody that we will be doing everything possible to remedy the situation
KEY-411978: I know we're a bit under-staffed in one or two positions and, hopefully, we can bring in a couple of new faces in the near future
KEY-411979: I don't entirely endorse their opinion; I can see where they're coming from but they have to trust that I know what I'm doing
KEY-411980: Do you have any comments on the story that [%male#2] is unhappy that you appear to have caved in to the demands of certain players and brought in some new signings?
KEY-411981: [%person#1-surname]: 'I'm in charge'
KEY-411983: I'm the manager here and, whilst players may agree or disagree with what's happened, it's ultimately my decision and nobody else's
KEY-411984: I felt we needed the new faces in order to help us achieve our targets. It's now down to those players who disagree with that to step up and prove that they should play ahead of anyone who's been brought in
KEY-411985: Some critics have spoken of the significant number of players out on loan from your club and have accused [%team#1-short] of stockpiling players. How do you react to such criticism?
KEY-411990: I think these so-called critics should find something more interesting to complain about
KEY-411991: Just because they're not currently at the club doesn't mean they're not part of the club. We're keeping very close tabs on how they're all doing and are sure they'll return better for the experience
KEY-411992: We're giving these players a fantastic opportunity to develop elsewhere before they return and push on for their place in the first team
KEY-411993: Let's be honest; not all these players are going to make it here, so these loan spells may determine which players are up to the standards we expect
KEY-411994: Football is a business and players don't increase in value if they're not playing any football
KEY-411995: You've had to leave [%person_list#1] out of your squads for both the [%comp#1-short] and [%comp#2-short]. How much of a blow is that to your plans?
KEY-411996: It's something we saw coming and had to make plans for, so whilst it's frustrating that they're unavailable, at least we're prepared to handle it
KEY-411997: Both your [%comp#1-short] and [%comp#2-short] squads are notable for the absence of [%person_list#1] despite having clear room to include them. Can you explain what happened there?
KEY-411998: It's left us all a bit red-faced but absolutely nobody noticed that the names weren't on the lists before we submitted them
KEY-411999: I left them out by choice. I have my reasons and they will become quite clear but I feel we're better off without them in the squads at this point in time
KEY-412000: It's been noted that you've signed a number of young players. Is this a conscious effort on the part of the club to build for the future?
KEY-412005: It's not really a deliberate policy and, knowing football, there's no guarantee I'll still be in charge by the time they've reached their prime
KEY-412006: Some of these players may be young but age is no barrier if they're a fantastic player
KEY-412007: I'd be crazy if I wasn't thinking about the future of this club. Signing these kinds of players gives us a better chance of a bright future
KEY-412008: They may not necessarily be able to improve the squad but at the very least they'll keep some of the more experienced players on their toes
KEY-412009: If I had the money to sign the finished article we wouldn't be having the conversation
KEY-412010: Given the large turnover in your squad over the last couple of seasons, do you feel you've earned a reputation as a manager always looking to do a deal?
KEY-412011: [%person#1-surname] looking out for [%team#1-short] best interests
KEY-412015: It's part of being a football manager. If I've earned a reputation for doing my job then so be it
KEY-412016: All signings and sales are carefully considered with the best interests of the club in mind
KEY-412017: When I arrived at the club there was a lot of dead wood and it's only natural, when rebuilding, for there to be a lot of transfer activity
KEY-412018: Sometimes I'll take a chance and sign someone. When doing so you often need to make some room in order to be able to do that
KEY-412019: What can I say? In some countries they'd call me a wheeler dealer. I change my mind about players based on their performances and love a bargain, there's no shame in that
KEY-412020: [%male#2] has enjoyed a rather productive loan spell at [%team#2-short] this season; do you think he's now ready to return to [%stadium#1] and play a role in the first team squad?
KEY-412025: We don't know at this stage. Part of the process is for everyone involved to sit down and discuss what's best for the player's career
KEY-412026: I think so, yes. This loan has shown that he's ready for the next step
KEY-412027: It's time to take a look at him and see how he's developed. He's done what we asked of him and I now have to decide if he's good enough
KEY-412028: I don't know. He's done well but it's hard to say whether that means he's ready to contribute for us right now. It's a big leap for him to be making
KEY-412029: I'm inclined to suggest that he's more likely to go back out on loan again to continue his development
KEY-412032: [%person#1-surname] wants consistency from [%male#2-surname]
KEY-412033: [%person#1-surname] questions [%male#2-surname] mentality
KEY-412034: [%person#1-surname] doubts [%male#2-surname] potential
KEY-412035: I haven't definitively said that he's not but it's an extremely high standard required here
KEY-412036: I just want to see him stand out even more; if he continues to make these strides then there will be room for him at [%team#1-short]
KEY-412037: It's a matter of consistency I think; I need to be able to rely on my players week in and week out
KEY-412038: I have to be sure that he has the right mentality to play for this club
KEY-412039: Not everybody is ultimately good enough to play here. We're not a charity case and if a player doesn't exhibit the hallmarks of the player profile we're after then it doesn't matter
KEY-412040: [%male#2] has enjoyed a rather productive loan spell at [%team#2-short] this season; what's the next step for him?
KEY-412042: I'd like to take a look at him in the first team. People might think that's a big ask after playing for a club like [%team#2-short] but I've seen enough to excite me
KEY-412043: I think he needs to go to another club - a bigger club - on loan and show that he can make that progression. If he can do that he's a little bit closer to contributing here
KEY-412044: [%male#2] has enjoyed a rather productive loan spell at [%team#2-short] but has now returned to [%stadium#1]. What will the rest of the season look like for him?
KEY-412045: [%person#1-surname] wants to see [%male#2-surname] develop in-house
KEY-412046: He's probably going to stay here for the time being. He'll train with the first team group when possible, and he'll probably play mainly for our developmental teams, but it's going to do him a lot of good to be back here
KEY-412047: With [%male#2] joining the club on trial, many people will want to know what the chances are of him earning a permanent stay at [%stadium#1]?
KEY-412053: I think there's a good chance; we've got to work out a deal but we thought it would be good to get him in and have a look at him whilst that happens
KEY-412054: It's up to him, we know how good he can be on his day and he knows there's a contract there waiting for him if he impresses
KEY-412055: He's just training with us for the time being. If we can work something out, great, but there's no pressure on either side right now
KEY-412057: [%male#2] appeared for [%team#1-short] as a trialist recently; will you be offering him a longer stay?
KEY-412058: We're going to continue to appraise our options and come to a decision in the near future
KEY-412059: I thought he played well and showed some of what he can bring to the table. I'd like to sign him if possible
KEY-412060: It's a part of the process. We've seen him in training and now in a match environment and it's a decent possibility at this stage
KEY-412061: He's come in here ready to make an impact and we're open to adding to our squad. We've not decided yet but nothing's going to happen immediately
KEY-412062: I thought he could have played a little better given that he's trying to earn a contract. That sort of thing raises alarm bells
KEY-412063: [%male#2] has been on trial with [%team#1-short] for a couple of weeks now; are you any closer to coming to a decision on his future?
KEY-412064: [%person#1-surname] set to decide on [%male#2-surname] future
KEY-412068: We're positive about the chances of a deal being worked out. It shouldn't take much longer
KEY-412069: Hopefully we can all get on the same page and get the deal over the line
KEY-412070: We've had a long, good look at him, but at this stage we're probably going to go in a different direction
KEY-412071: I wouldn't expect anything to happen now. If it was meant to be it would've already happened
KEY-412072: [%male#2] has left [%team#1-short] after an unsuccessful trial spell and, given you previously indicated that you were keen to sign him, the fans would like to know what happened here?
KEY-412073: [%person#1-surname] couldn't agree terms with [%male#2-surname]
KEY-412074: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] deal wasn't to be
KEY-412075: [%male#2-surname] didn't suit [%team#1-short] says [%person#1-surname]
KEY-412076: [%male#2-surname] 'wasn't good enough' for [%team#1-short]
KEY-412077: I have nothing to say on the matter. It's football at the end of the day
KEY-412078: We just couldn't agree to terms, it's as simple as that
KEY-412079: Progress was made and he would've added something to the squad but, in the end, both parties went in different directions
KEY-412080: We felt that he didn't suit the squad at this point in time
KEY-412081: I was premature in being optimistic about a deal. As it transpired, he never looked like being good enough
KEY-412082: Recent reports have suggested that you are keen on making [%male#3] loan stay a permanent one. Are you prepared to go on record with your thoughts on this story?
KEY-412083: I would love to make him part of the team on a permanent basis and we are working towards that end
KEY-412085: There's been a swell of media attention surrounding your possible interest in [%team#2-short] [%position#2-lowercase-nosides] [%male#2] in a deal potentially worth [%cash#1]. Is that a deal you realistically think you're capable of pulling off?
KEY-412091: He's our absolute number one priority and a player who can take us to the next level. We've got the money and we're going to do everything we can to bring him in
KEY-412092: It's a big deal, sure, but we're determined to make it happen. He's the sort of player you can't turn down if there's a chance of signing him
KEY-412093: It's a little too early to say, we're interested and we think we can move forward with a deal but there's a lot that can happen yet
KEY-412094: I don't know. Everyone knows we're interested but whether anything develops from here is a lot harder to say right now
KEY-412095: A lot of recent rumours have hinted at your possible interest in [%team#2-short] [%position#2-lowercase-nosides] [%male#2] in what would, of course, be a huge transfer for the club. Do you think you've got a chance of making it happen?
KEY-412100: He's our absolute number one priority and a player who can take us to the next level. We've got the money and we're going to do everything we can to bring him in
KEY-412101: It's a big deal, sure, but we're determined to make it happen. He's the sort of player you can't turn down if there's a chance of signing him
KEY-412102: It's a little too early to say, we're interested and we think we can move forward with a deal but there's a lot that can happen yet
KEY-412103: I don't know. Everyone knows we're interested but whether anything develops from here is a lot harder to say right now
KEY-412104: There's been plenty of debate over your possible interest in [%team#2-short] [%position#2-lowercase-nosides] [%male#2] amid suggestions that he represents a wildly unrealistic target for a club like [%person#1-yours]. What makes you think you can pull this deal off?
KEY-412105: [%person#1-surname] setting targets high with [%male#2-surname] interest
KEY-412107: Is it wrong to be ambitious? You might not think it's realistic but this club is going places and, by going out and bringing in a player of his stature, we can set our targets higher. He would be an absolute game-changer for our club
KEY-412108: You don't know until you try; we think we've got an attractive offer and we're going to move forward determined to get our man
KEY-412109: Why not? The worst that can happen is that we end up back where we started, but there's no harm in trying and putting our case across
KEY-412111: There's been plenty of debate over your possible interest in [%team#2-short] [%position#2-lowercase-nosides] [%male#2] with plenty of people baffled by the rumour. The simple question here really is...why?
KEY-412112: [%person#1-surname] tells media to 'wait and see' over [%male#2-surname] interest
KEY-412114: [%person#1-surname] claims [%male#2-surname] is under-rated following transfer rumours
KEY-412116: You can all put me on record right now, wait and see. We're going to make this deal and he's going to shock everyone by just how good he is
KEY-412117: He's a really good player, and if everyone can't see that then all the better for us. He can make us considerably better
KEY-412118: I think he's often been under-rated and represents the exact sort of signing we're trying to make. You'll be looking back on this question with regret before very long
KEY-412119: I know it's a risk but we've identified him as a player we'd like to sign and we're going to proceed with that plan
KEY-412120: You have recently made clear your intention to bring [%team#2-short] [%position#2-lowercase-nosides] [%male#2] in to the club and declared him your number one target. Do you think you've got a chance of making it happen?
KEY-412121: Your decision to mark [%team#2-short] [%position#2-lowercase-nosides] [%male#2] as your number one target has been received with confusion in many quarters as people are left wondering why you have chosen to look elsewhere after previously intimating that [%male#3] was your preferred signing. Can you enlighten us further?
KEY-412124: [%person#1-surname] claims [%male#3-surname] is under-rated following transfer rumours
KEY-412126: I've been thinking about it a lot and have come to the conclusion that [%male#3-first] would be of greater benefit to the club both now and in the future
KEY-412127: We're in the business of acquiring top quality players and he's definitely someone we want here
KEY-412128: He's flown somewhat under the radar and, whilst we could have moved forward with the deal without taking this step, we felt he deserves to be acknowledged like this
KEY-412129: I fully accept it's something of a risk to be seen doing this in public but we've changed our minds and are focusing fully on signing [%male#3-surname]
KEY-412130: You haven't opened the chequebook for a permanent signing during this transfer window but you have dipped into the loan market. Is this reflective of the lack of funds you have available to you?
KEY-412135: I'm not about to go into the specifics of the club's financial situation
KEY-412136: It's nothing to do with money; I'm sure the board would have backed me if there were a player we wanted to sign permanently
KEY-412137: I'm happy with the business we've done. Sometimes getting players on loan can be the best option
KEY-412138: Unfortunately so, I'd have loved to splash out on a marquee signing but we just couldn't make it happen
KEY-412139: There were players we were watching closely but I'm afraid a deal wasn't suitable for the club at this time
KEY-412140: You've confirmed the loan signing of [%male#2] during the window. How much of an impact do you think he can have on the rest of the season?
KEY-412141: [%person#1-surname] says [%male#2-surname] can do 'great things'
KEY-412142: [%person#1-surname] lauds 'terrific talent' [%male#2-surname]
KEY-412143: [%person#1-surname] expects [%male#2-surname] to need time
KEY-412144: [%person#1-surname] forced to settle for loans
KEY-412146: We're delighted to have him and I think he can do great things here
KEY-412147: I'm really pleased that [%team#2-short] agreed to send him here; I think he's a terrific talent
KEY-412148: We're not too sure at the moment; he hasn't had a lot of football recently. It may take a while for him to find his match sharpness
KEY-412149: Ideally we'd like to be able to sign players on permanent deals so we can ease them in more conveniently but we'll have to take what we can get at this stage
KEY-412150: You must only just be getting your breath back after the hectic transfer deadline day. How pleased were you to bring in this group of players?
KEY-412151: [%person#1-surname] pleased with busy transfer day
KEY-412153: [%person#1-surname] not a fan of deadline day business
KEY-412154: [%person#1-surname] slams deadline day 'madness'
KEY-412155: It's part and parcel of the game; we'll have to wait and see how well they do before I'm able to say how pleased I am
KEY-412156: You're right, it was a chaotic day from start to finish. It was all worth it though, we're delighted with the business we did
KEY-412157: I think relief was the main emotion I felt, you always run the risk of missing out on players if you leave it too late but thankfully we were just in time
KEY-412158: We got some decent enough players in the end but bringing in players on deadline day is like shopping in a town centre when half the shops are shut; we were limited in terms of what we could do
KEY-412159: I don't like the madness of deadline day and you won't be seeing another one like that from us any time soon
KEY-412160: You managed to bring in [%male#2] on deadline day; were you ever tempted to get one or two more in before the deadline?
KEY-412161: [%person#1-surname] pleased to land [%male#2-surname]
KEY-412162: [%person#1-surname] was tempted to make further signings
KEY-412163: [%person#1-surname] failed to land deadline day targets
KEY-412164: [%person#1-surname] disappointed with deadline day
KEY-412165: I don't see the need to talk about what might have happened, let's focus on what did happen instead
KEY-412166: No, I didn't want to do any dealings just for the sake of it. We targeted [%male#2-first] and we're pleased we got him
KEY-412167: Of course it can be tempting but on the whole, we've got to be happy that [%male#2-first] has joined the club
KEY-412168: We tried for one or two others as well, but you can't land every player you go for
KEY-412169: I'm disappointed with deadline day to be honest, we could and should have done much more
KEY-412170: You enjoyed a rather quiet transfer deadline day which saw no players coming into the club. Was that intentional?
KEY-412172: [%person#1-surname] no fan of deadline day
KEY-412175: Let's leave that stuff for people who were actually involved in deadline day
KEY-412176: Absolutely, we didn't want to do any business at the last minute. I had sympathy for some of my counterparts, I was tucked up in bed well ahead of the deadline
KEY-412177: Everyone goes a bit mad on deadline day, don't they? All those fans standing outside their club's stadium, cheering in front of television cameras. It's not for me
KEY-412179: I have to admit I was disappointed not to bring anybody in; we certainly tried
KEY-412180: In terms of outgoings, [%person_list#1] left the club. Was there a real need to trim the squad?
KEY-412183: [%person#1-surname] says no strategy for deadline day sales
KEY-412186: Yes, we'd been trying to offload players during the whole window but a lot of the buying clubs only became interested on deadline day. Thankfully in the end we managed to conclude the deals
KEY-412187: Not only to trim the squad but also to raise funds. We lost one or two decent players but we needed to
KEY-412188: I wouldn't say that, no. We received some bids and dealt with each one separately. It wasn't part of a strategy or anything like that
KEY-412189: I didn't want to lose those players and I'm annoyed that the buying clubs left it so late; we didn't have enough time to buy replacements
KEY-412190: In terms of outgoings, [%male#2] departed for [%team#2-short]. Was that a deal you really wanted to do or was it taken out of your hands?
KEY-412191: [%person#1-surname] happy to offload [%male#2-surname]
KEY-412192: [%person#1-surname] hopes time vindicates [%male#2-surname] departure
KEY-412194: [%person#1-surname] angry following [%male#2-surname] departure
KEY-412195: We certainly wanted to do the deal, we feel the squad is in better shape without him
KEY-412196: It's difficult on deadline day, you don't have much time to weigh things up. Hopefully time will prove we got the decision right
KEY-412197: It was up to the player really, and clearly he wanted the move so good luck to him
KEY-412198: I didn't want to get rid of [%male#2-first], no. I enjoyed working with him but sometimes these things are out of your hands
KEY-412199: [%male#2] has taken what some might claim is a step backwards in order to join [%team#1-short]. Do you think he'll find it easier to succeed here?
KEY-412204: I'm not here to discuss what level our club is at compared to others, I'm here because we're presenting [%male#2] to the media and our fans
KEY-412205: I think he's a great player and [%team#2-short] have made a massive mistake in letting him go
KEY-412206: I think it says a lot more about the project we're building here than anything else
KEY-412207: Some players just need a bit of confidence and I'm sure he'll be able to get that playing regularly for us. It's also important for him to be playing so he can achieve his international ambitions
KEY-412208: He found it tough there. Sometimes players need to reassess their careers and we're a club where he can do that
KEY-412209: Given [%male#2] age and the fact [%team#2-short] decided he was no longer in their plans, do you think he's still got the ambition to be a success for [%team#1-short]?
KEY-412214: I think too many people pay attention to age. He's a professional and everything else is irrelevant
KEY-412215: He's still got the quality and I have no doubt the ambition to be a massive success at this club
KEY-412216: I don't have any worries. He just wants to play football and we're lucky enough that he'll be doing so for us
KEY-412217: We're aware it's unlikely to be a long-term signing but we're willing to take a chance on him
KEY-412218: Some footballers of his age are just looking for a final pay day and time will tell if that's the case here
KEY-412219: [%team#1-short] are [%male#2] [%number#1-nth_text] club; do you think it's a risk to sign a player with perhaps some question marks about his loyalty?
KEY-412227: Well, fans who want his name on the back of their shirts may want to wait a little while first, just in case
KEY-412228: If he shows the same kind of movement on the football pitch that he's shown in moving clubs, the opposition will have trouble keeping track of him!
KEY-412235: I can't overstate how much of a loss he'll be. Saying that, it's a great opportunity for someone to step up to guide some of the younger players much like he did
KEY-412238: To be honest it's about time. Just because someone was once appointed captain doesn't necessarily mean upon reflection it was the right decision and I'm glad he's no longer around
KEY-412239: You've pulled it off, a magnificent unbeaten season. How proud are you of such an achievement?
KEY-412242: I haven't really thought about it too much; I expect I'll realise the magnitude of it in due course but we've had so many other things to focus on of late
KEY-412243: It's an absolutely incredible achievement and everyone at the club deserves huge credit. We've made history
KEY-412245: I'm really just happy with how the season has gone overall; the unbeaten run was never something we really targeted and just sort of, you know, happened
KEY-412246: We were able to control certain things throughout the season but we owe a fair amount of credit to lady luck here, that much cannot be denied
KEY-412248: We're going to take our time to celebrate this season right now, there'll be plenty of time to look forward to next season
KEY-412249: We'll go into the new campaign full of confidence and there's no reason this can't last a bit longer
KEY-412250: I fully expect us to pick up where we left off and we'll be favourites to win a good few more matches before this run is done
KEY-412251: I think if you look at the depth of quality throughout this squad we've got a good chance to keep this thing going
