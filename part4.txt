STR-1:

KEY-508078: After speaking with [%male#3], [%person#1-I] believe he appreciates that [%person#2-you] have made a number of signings to strengthen the first team squad at [%position#1] but feels that the squad still isn't strong enough.
STR-1:

KEY-508079: After speaking with [%male#3], [%person#1-I] believe that the player appreciates that the club came very close to winning a domestic cup and is prepared to give [%person#2-you] another season to make the extra step up required to secure a trophy.
STR-1:

KEY-508080: After speaking with [%male#3], [%person#1-I] believe that the player understands the club getting knocked out of the [%comp#4-short] by a team of [%team#5-short]'s calibre and he is prepared to give [%person#2-you] another season to try to win a domestic cup.
STR-1:

KEY-508081: Do [%person#1-you] think [%male#3] was lucky to stay on the pitch, particularly after VAR had a look at the incident?
STR-1:

KEY-508082: It's really not for [%person#1-me] to say
STR-1:

KEY-508083: [%person#1-surname]: VAR got [%male#3-surname] decision wrong
STR-1:

KEY-508084: If [%person#1-I] was [%person#2-I], [%person#1-I]'d be pretty happy right now. [%person#1-I] think VAR got that wrong
STR-1:

KEY-508085: [%male#3-surname] 'fortunate' to avoid red, says [%person#1-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508086: When they went to VAR [%person#1-I] expected the worst, so it's fair to say he was a bit fortunate
STR-1:

KEY-508087: [%person#1-surname] backs VAR in [%male#3-surname] controversy
STR-1:

KEY-508088: We're only supposed to have VAR intervene if there's a clear and obvious error and that wasn't the case here
STR-1:

KEY-508089: [%person#1-surname]: VAR works
STR-1:

KEY-508090: [%person#1-I]'m sure [%person#2] will see it differently but [%person#1-I] thought the decision was spot-on. VAR had a look and made the right decision; the system works
STR-1:

KEY-508091: The decision by VAR to give [%team#2-short] a penalty has reignited talk that [%person#2]{s} teams get more than their fair share of controversial calls go their way. Do [%person#1-you] want to say anything about that?
STR-1:

KEY-508092: [%person#1-surname] hits out at [%person#2-surname] after VAR controversy
STR-1:

KEY-508093: When you go around acting like [%person#2-he] does, intimidating officials and expecting to get [%person#2-his] way, it's hardly a shock to see these things happen
STR-1:

KEY-508094: Following a red card for [%male#3] which saw VAR come to the fore again, do [%person#2-you] share the opinion of those who think [%person#2] and [%team#2-short] get more than their fair share of decisions go their way?
STR-1:

KEY-508095: [%person#1-surname] rages as VAR sends [%male#3-surname] off
STR-1:

KEY-508096: VAR simply isn't fit for purpose. It was a terrible decision and it's certainly no shock at all that [%person#2-surname] got the rub of the green again
STR-1:

KEY-508097: [%person#1-surname] distances [%person#1-himself] from [%person#2-surname] controversy
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-508102: [%person#1-surname] backs VAR over [%male#3-surname] decision
STR-1:

KEY-508103: [%person#1-I] don't like players being sent off without deserving it, and this one certainly wasn't a red card offence. VAR did its job here
STR-1:

KEY-508104: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#3-surname] VAR decision was correct
STR-1:

KEY-508105: It was a close one but [%person#1-I] think they got it right. It's only there for if it's clear and obvious, and that certainly wasn't
STR-1:

KEY-508106: [%person#1-surname] felt [%male#3-surname] should have seen VAR red
STR-1:

KEY-508107: [%person#1-I] don't think this was a good one for VAR; [%person#1-my] first instinct was that it should've been a red card
STR-1:

KEY-508108: [%person#1-surname] critical of VAR in [%male#3-surname] controversy
STR-1:

KEY-508109: It was one of the clearest red card offences you're ever likely to see and [%person#1-I] don't know what VAR is there for if not to make decisions like that
STR-1:

KEY-508110: [%person#2] has suggested that the VAR made the right decision in allowing [%male#3] to remain on the pitch. Do [%person#1-you] agree?
STR-1:

KEY-508111: [%person#1-surname] backs VAR over [%male#3-surname] decision
STR-1:

KEY-508112: There's no controversy here, it wasn't a red card, and VAR made the right decision
STR-1:

KEY-508113: [%person#1-surname] believes [%male#3-surname] VAR decision was correct
STR-1:

KEY-508114: If it's not clear and obvious then it's not a red. The fact we're discussing whether or not it was right suggests they did their job
STR-1:

KEY-508115: [%person#1-surname] felt [%male#3-surname] should have seen VAR red
STR-1:

KEY-508116: [%person#1-My] initial reaction was that it should've been a red card and it's concerning that VAR didn't see it the same way
STR-1:

KEY-508117: [%person#1-surname] outraged VAR let-off for [%male#3-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508118: It was one of the clearest red card offences you're ever likely to see and [%person#1-I] don't know why VAR is being used if not to get decisions like that one right
STR-1:

KEY-508119: [%person#2]{s} reaction to the controversial [%male#3] incident clearly suggested [%person#2-he] was unhappy with VAR and [%person#1-your] post-match remarks. Do [%person#1-you] have anything to add to the discussion?
STR-1:

KEY-508120: [%person#1-surname] doesn't think [%male#3-surname] should've seen red
STR-1:

KEY-508121: People don't agree on every single thing; it's perfectly fine if [%person#2-he] thinks it was worthy of a red card. [%person#1-I] didn't and neither did VAR
STR-1:

KEY-508122: [%person#1-surname]: VAR right over [%male#3-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508123: It's all been blown rather out of proportion. VAR got it right and we can't keep undermining the system by talking about every single decision
STR-1:

KEY-508124: [%person#1-surname] refuses to take [%person#2-surname]{s} bait
STR-1:

KEY-508126: [%person#1-surname] takes aim at 'tiresome' [%person#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508127: [%person#1-I]'m sure people in football aren't surprised by [%person#2-surname]{s} reaction, but [%person#1-I] would imagine they're finding [%person#2-him] increasingly tiresome

STR-1:

KEY-508129: [%person#1-surname] keen to move on from [%male#3-surname] VAR controversy
STR-1:

KEY-508130: [%person#1-I] think it's time to move on. We're unlikely to agree so it's a waste of time talking about it
STR-1:

KEY-508131: [%person#1-surname] says VAR got [%male#3-surname] call wrong
STR-1:

KEY-508132: [%person#2-He] has [%person#2-his] interpretation, [%person#1-I] have [%person#2-mine]. VAR got it wrong this time but maybe we'll have better luck in the future
STR-1:

KEY-508133: [%person#1-surname] hits out at 'embarrassing' [%person#2-surname] as VAR controversy drags on
STR-1:

KEY-508134: If [%person#2-he]'s prepared to embarrass [%person#2-himself] with outrageous claims, who am [%person#1-I] to intervene? [%person#2-He]'s showing [%person#2-his] true colours
STR-1:

KEY-508135: [%person#1-surname] confirms dislike for [%person#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508136: [%person#1-I] don't like [%person#2-him] and [%person#2-his] attitude here has only served to confirm that [%person#2-he]'s not a nice person
STR-1:

KEY-508137: [%person#referee] gave another decision against [%person#1-your] team today; is [%person#referee-he] becoming something of a 'bogey referee' to [%team#1-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-508138: [%person#1-author-I]'m not going to get [%person#1-myself] in trouble by talking about refereeing decisions
STR-1:

KEY-508139: [%person#1-surname] sympathises with officials
STR-1:

KEY-508140: [%person#1-I] don't want to criticise anyone, and certainly not hand out labels that stick. The officials don't have an easy job
STR-1:

KEY-508141: [%person#1-surname]: 'These things happen'
STR-1:

KEY-508142: These things happen and, as much as it might frustrate [%person#1-surname], [%person#1-I] can't afford to dwell on it
STR-1:

KEY-508143: [%person#1-surname] 'doesn't believe in coincidence' after latest [%team#1-short] controversy
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-508145: [%person#1-surname] claims [%team#1-short] are being 'targeted' by officials
STR-1:

KEY-508146: [%person#1-I]'ve had enough; we're being targeted by the officials and it's simply unfair
STR-1:

KEY-508147: [%person#2] has hit out at [%person#referee]{s} decision and claimed that [%team#2-short] are being victimised by at least one official. Do [%person#1-you] have any reaction to those comments?
STR-1:

KEY-508148: [%person#2-He]'s perfectly entitled to say whatever [%person#2-he] wants, it's none of [%person#1-my] business
STR-1:

KEY-508149: [%person#1-surname] backs [%person#2-surname] over refereeing controversy
STR-1:

KEY-508150: [%person#1-I] think [%person#2-he]'s right to be angry, it wasn't a good decision, was it?
STR-1:

KEY-508151: [%person#1-surname]: [%person#2-surname] has a point
STR-1:

KEY-508152: [%person#1-I] think [%person#1-he] has a point; we need a serious conversation about the standard of refereeing in this league
STR-1:

KEY-508153: [%person#1-surname] laughs off [%person#2-surname]{s} criticism of referees
STR-1:

KEY-508154: [%person#2-He]'s playing you all, surely you get that? Instead of focusing on the football, [%person#2-he]'s distracting you with nonsense like this
STR-1:

KEY-508155: [%person#1-surname] says [%person#2-surname] should 'stop making excuses'
STR-1:

KEY-508156: [%person#2-He]'d be better off trying to improve [%person#2-his] team rather than making pathetic excuses like this
STR-1:

KEY-508157: [%person#2] took [%person#1-your] side over [%person#referee]{s} decision. Does that vindicate [%person#1-your] stance?
STR-1:

KEY-508158: [%person#1-I] don't think it'll change anything, if that's what you're asking
STR-1:

KEY-508159: [%person#1-surname] appreciates support against officials
STR-1:

KEY-508160: [%person#1-I] appreciate anyone who comes out and takes a stand against poor decisions from our officials. It's the only way we'll change things
STR-1:

KEY-508161: [%person#1-surname]: [%person#2-surname] knows the truth
STR-1:

KEY-508162: [%person#2-He] knows the truth and it's inescapable as far as we're concerned. We've been hurt by bad decisions for too long now
STR-1:

KEY-508163: [%person#1-surname] doubts sincerity of [%person#2-surname]{s} support
STR-1:

KEY-508164: It's easy for [%person#2-him] to say but we'll see how much [%person#2-he] really means it the next time [%team#2-short] are in our position
STR-1:

KEY-508165: [%person#1-surname] dismisses [%person#2-surname]{s} show of support
STR-1:

KEY-508166: [%person#1-I] don't care for [%person#2-his] comments, they make no difference to [%person#1-me] whatsoever
STR-1:

KEY-508167: [%person#2] had some rather pointed criticism of [%person#1-your] recent comments about [%person#referee]{s} decisions. Does [%person#2-he] have a point when saying that 'these things happen'?
STR-1:

KEY-508168: [%person#1-I]'m not getting into a war of words with another manager, it's not worth it
STR-1:

KEY-508169: [%person#1-surname] backs away from [%person#referee-surname] criticism
STR-1:

KEY-508170: [%person#1-I] might have been a little over the top when speaking in the heat of the moment, yes, but [%person#1-I]'m hardly the first manager to do so
STR-1:

KEY-508171: [%person#1-surname] reconsiders [%person#referee-surname] criticism
STR-1:

KEY-508172: [%person#1-I] still think [%person#1-I] have an important point to make but it's important to deliver it in the right manner
STR-1:

KEY-508173: [%person#1-surname]: [%person#2-surname]{s} opinion doesn't matter
STR-1:

KEY-508174: What [%person#2-first] thinks is not important. Why [%person#2-he] decided to get involved in the discussion is beyond [%person#1-me]
STR-1:

KEY-508175: [%person#1-surname] continues war of words with [%person#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508176: [%person#2-He] would say that, wouldn't [%person#2-he]? [%person#2-He]'s gone down in [%person#1-my] estimation after this
STR-1:

KEY-508177: Following another controversial refereeing decision going against [%team#1-short], do [%person#1-you] feel [%person#1-your] team is being victimised?
STR-1:

KEY-508178: [%person#2] has hit out following the controversy in [%person#1-your] match and claimed that [%team#2-short] are being victimised by officials. Do [%person#1-you] have any reaction to those comments?
STR-1:

KEY-508179: [%person#2] took [%person#1-your] side over recent refereeing controversies. Does that vindicate [%person#1-your] stance?
STR-1:

KEY-508180: [%person#2] had some rather pointed criticism of [%person#1-your] recent comments about refereeing decisions. Does [%person#2-he] have a point when saying that 'these things happen'?
STR-1:

KEY-508181: [%person#1-surname] backs away from refereeing criticism
STR-1:

KEY-508182: [%person#1-surname] reconsiders refereeing criticism
STR-1:

KEY-508183: [%person#referee] takes charge of this match; the last time [%person#referee-he] officiated [%team#1-short] there was no small measure of controversy. Are [%person#1-you] concerned the same could happen again?
STR-1:

KEY-508184: Let's wait and see what happens, shall we?
STR-1:

KEY-508185: [%person#1-surname] refuses to condemn [%person#referee-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508186: [%person#1-I] don't have a reason to be concerned; what's done is done, and this is a new match
STR-1:

KEY-508187: [%person#1-surname] 'bears no grudges' against [%person#referee-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508188: Being a referee is a thankless task and, whatever [%person#1-I] might have said about things, [%person#1-I] bear no grudges. Let's move forward positively
STR-1:

KEY-508189: [%person#1-surname] warns [%person#referee-surname] to 'get things right'
STR-1:

KEY-508190: It goes without saying that every referee should be going out there with the intention of getting everything right. If not, [%person#1-I]'ll have something to say
STR-1:

KEY-508191: [%person#1-surname] not keen on [%person#referee-surname] choice
STR-1:

KEY-508192: To be honest [%person#1-I]'d rather a different referee altogether. It's cast a cloud over our preparation for sure
STR-1:

KEY-508193: [%person#2] expressed [%person#2-his] disappointment at the selection of [%person#referee] to officiate the match. How do [%person#2-you] see things?
STR-1:

KEY-508194: [%person#1-I] really don't want to get involved in any of that
STR-1:

KEY-508195: [%person#1-surname] understands [%person#2-surname]{s} referee frustrations
STR-1:

KEY-508196: [%person#1-I]'d probably say the same thing if it was a referee with whom we've not fared well. It's got to be a little bit of a worry from [%person#2-his] perspective
STR-1:

KEY-508197: [%person#1-surname] wants to see strong officiating from [%person#referee-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508198: We all know that referees don't have it easy, but they have a job to do, and we all expect them to do it well. There's nothing wrong with holding everyone to account
STR-1:

KEY-508199: [%person#1-surname]: [%person#2-surname] is playing a game
STR-1:

KEY-508200: [%person#2-first] is just playing the same sort of game other managers - even [%person#1-myself] - have played in the build-up to a big match. It's a classic distraction technique and it's not really needed
STR-1:

KEY-508201: [%person#2-surname]{s} refereeing comments 'childish', says [%person#1-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508202: [%person#2-He]'s being really childish and it's terribly unprofessional to try to cast doubt on the officials before the match in an attempt to influence their performance
STR-1:

KEY-508203: [%person#1-You] expressed concern before the match that [%person#referee] might cost [%person#1-your] team the match and those concerns were justified. How do [%person#1-you] feel now?
STR-1:

KEY-508204: [%person#1-I]'ll get in trouble if [%person#1-I] say how [%person#1-I] really feel
STR-1:

KEY-508205: [%person#1-surname] refuses to blame officials
STR-1:

KEY-508206: [%person#1-surname]'m more angry at our performance than anything the officials did
STR-1:

KEY-508207: [%person#1-surname] takes no pleasure in being right
STR-1:

KEY-508208: It's a hollow victory, if you can even describe it as a victory, because being right in this case has done us absolutely no favours. [%person#1-I]'m disappointed
STR-1:

KEY-508209: [%person#1-surname] takes aim at [%person#referee-surname] again
STR-1:

KEY-508210: It was clear to anyone who knew our history with this particular referee that it was going to happen, so why was [%person#referee-he] assigned to this match? It beggars belief
STR-1:

KEY-508211: [%person#1-surname] wants [%person#referee-surname] banned from future [%team#1-short] matches
STR-1:

KEY-508212: As far as [%person#1-I]'m concerned [%person#referee-he] should never officiate another one of our matches. It's beyond unacceptable
STR-1:

KEY-508213: Despite [%person#1-your] pre-match concerns about the appointment of [%person#referee], [%person#referee-he] ended up helping [%person#1-your] team rather than hindering them. How do [%person#1-you] feel about those comments now?
STR-1:

KEY-508214: [%person#1-I]'d probably be better served by not saying anything
STR-1:

KEY-508215: [%person#1-surname] admits [%person#1-he] was wrong to criticise [%person#referee-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508216: [%person#1-I] was wrong to say what [%person#1-I] said and [%person#1-I] apologise for that
STR-1:

KEY-508217: [%person#1-surname] backs down from refereeing criticism
STR-1:

KEY-508218: [%person#1-I] believe [%person#1-my] concerns were well-founded but the public arena perhaps wasn't the best place to express them
STR-1:

KEY-508219: [%person#1-surname] stands by [%person#referee-surname] comments
STR-1:

KEY-508220: [%person#1-I] stand by them and, as much as we might have benefitted today, next time we might not be so lucky
STR-1:

KEY-508221: [%person#1-surname] doubles down on refereeing criticism
STR-1:

KEY-508222: [%person#1-I] think they're even more valid in the wake of what we just witnessed. [%person#2] probably isn't best pleased by some of the decisions made today and it's that inconsistency that we need to address
STR-1:

KEY-508223: After [%person#1-your] pointed pre-match criticism of [%person#referee], the officials had no impact on the outcome here. Do [%person#1-you] perhaps owe them an apology?
STR-1:

KEY-508224: [%person#1-I]'m not going to say anything that could possibly get [%person#1-me] in trouble
STR-1:

KEY-508225: [%person#1-surname] apologises to officials
STR-1:

KEY-508226: [%person#1-I] will hold [%person#1-my] hands up and apologise, yes, [%person#1-I] shouldn't have said what [%person#1-I] did
STR-1:

KEY-508227: [%person#1-surname] 'went too far' in [%person#referee-surname] criticism
STR-1:

KEY-508228: [%person#1-I] think [%person#1-my] intentions were fair but [%person#1-I] perhaps went too far in expressing them. [%person#1-I] apologise if they felt [%person#1-my] comments were out of line
STR-1:

KEY-508229: [%person#1-surname]: Pre-match comments worked
STR-1:

KEY-508230: If anything [%person#1-I]'ve been vindicated. [%person#1-I] wanted a fair match without the officials influencing the outcome and that's exactly what we got
STR-1:

KEY-508231: [%person#1-surname] wants officials seen and not heard
STR-1:

KEY-508232: This is what we need from the referees now; they should be seen but not heard, and [%person#1-I] think more managers need to say the sort of things [%person#1-I] said ahead of the match if we're going to see that happen
STR-1:

KEY-508233: What do [%person#1-you] make of [%person#2]{s} criticism of referee [%person#referee] pre-match, which would later prove prescient as [%team#2-short] suffered at the hands of the officials?
STR-1:

KEY-508234: [%person#1-I]'ll leave all refereeing talk to [%person#2-him], [%person#2-he]'s clearly got it covered enough for the both of us
STR-1:

KEY-508235: [%person#1-surname] shares [%person#2-surname]{s} frustration over officiating
STR-1:

KEY-508236: It shouldn't matter that we benefitted from things today; everyone should want consistency and quality from our officials and we're just not getting that
STR-1:

KEY-508237: [%person#1-surname]: [%person#2-surname] was right to speak out
STR-1:

KEY-508238: It's hard to say he wasn't right to speak out after what happened. We need to hold everyone to account if we're to see an improvement
STR-1:

KEY-508239: [%person#2-surname] 'got what was coming to [%person#2-him]'
STR-1:

KEY-508240: [%person#2-He] can hardly complain after those comments. [%person#2-He] got what was coming to [%person#2-him]
STR-1:

KEY-508241: [%person#1-surname] tells [%person#2-surname] to support officials as controversy reigns
STR-1:

KEY-508242: If [%person#2-he] wants better decisions from our officials [%person#2-he] should try supporting them. Is it any wonder [%person#2-he] feels hard done by if all [%person#2-he] does is moan about referees?
STR-1:

KEY-508243: After [%person#2] targeted [%person#referee] for pre-match criticism, [%person#2-his] [%team#2-short] team ended up getting the better of the controversial decisions. How did that make [%person#1-you] feel?
STR-1:

KEY-508244: [%person#1-I] don't really want to get involved with any of that nonsense
STR-1:

KEY-508245: [%person#1-surname] won't stress about refereeing decisions
STR-1:

KEY-508246: Some managers are very keen to talk about referees and everything that goes with it but it's not for [%person#1-me]. [%person#1-I] can't afford to stress about things out of [%person#1-my] control
STR-1:

KEY-508247: [%person#1-surname] believes decisions balance themselves out
STR-1:

KEY-508248: These things balance themselves out over time; if we were dealt a bad hand today, we might get a better one next time, and that's how these things work
STR-1:

KEY-508249: [%person#1-surname] didn't appreciate [%person#2-surname]{s} tactics
STR-1:

KEY-508250: [%person#1-I] don't think we need to bring the officials into the spotlight any more than they already are. It was pretty underhand stuff from [%person#2-surname] and [%person#1-I] think [%person#2-he] knows that
STR-1:

KEY-508251: [%person#1-surname]: [%person#2-surname] was out of order
STR-1:

KEY-508252: [%person#2-He] was utterly out of order and [%person#2-he]'s clearly had an influence on the match with those comments. That sort of behaviour should be punished
STR-1:

KEY-508253: How do [%person#1-you] feel about [%person#2]{s} pre-match concerns about [%person#referee] officiating this match when, in the end, the officials didn't impact things whatsoever?
STR-1:

KEY-508254: [%person#1-I]'m tired of talking about officiating all the time
STR-1:

KEY-508255: [%person#1-surname]: [%person#2-surname] free to say whatever [%person#2-he] wants
STR-1:

KEY-508256: [%person#2-first] is free to speak about whatever [%person#2-he] wants. It's nothing to do with [%person#1-me]
STR-1:

KEY-508257: [%person#1-surname] feels [%person#2-surname] had point about referee
STR-1:

KEY-508258: [%person#1-I] think [%person#2-his] concerns were valid. Even if nothing happened today, they had valid issues with the referee, and [%person#1-I] sympathise with that a lot
STR-1:

KEY-508259: [%person#1-surname]: [%person#2-surname] will learn from this
STR-1:

KEY-508260: [%person#1-I] hope [%person#2-first] learns a lesson from this. [%person#2-He] looks a lot worse after the event and it's important to keep certain frustrations private
STR-1:

KEY-508261: [%person#1-surname] 'lost respect' for [%person#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508262: [%person#1-I]'ve lost respect for [%person#2-him] as a result of those comments. They have no place in our game
STR-1:

KEY-508263: [%person#2] was certainly not happy with some of [%person#1-your] comments about officiating surrounding [%person#1-your] recent match. Will this war of words continue?
STR-1:

KEY-508264: That's up to you lot in the media
STR-1:

KEY-508265: [%person#1-surname] not interested in continuing [%person#2-surname] discussion
STR-1:

KEY-508266: [%person#1-I]'ve got many more important things to do than continue to humour [%person#1-him]
STR-1:

KEY-508267: [%person#1-surname] keen to move on from [%team#2-short] match
STR-1:

KEY-508268: [%person#1-surname]'d like to move on and focus on our next match if that's alright?
STR-1:

KEY-508269: [%person#1-surname] labels [%person#2-surname] as 'childish' as spat continues
STR-1:

KEY-508270: If [%person#2-he] wants to be childish then [%person#1-I] certainly won't stop [%person#2-him]
STR-1:

KEY-508271: [%person#1-surname] draws battle lines against [%person#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508272: If he wants an enemy, [%person#1-I]'ll give [%person#2-him] one. This doesn't end here
STR-1:

KEY-508273: [%team#1-short] face a fine for failing to control their players after picking up [%number#1-text] yellow cards today. Do [%person#1-you] think referee [%person#referee] was to blame in any way?
STR-1:

KEY-508274: [%person#1-I]'m in no mood for controversy today
STR-1:

KEY-508275: [%person#1-surname]: We lost our cool
STR-1:

KEY-508276: It was nothing to do with the officials, we lost our cool, and we deserve the punishment coming our way
STR-1:

KEY-508277: [%person#1-surname] disappointed with [%team#1-short]{s} conduct
STR-1:

KEY-508278: These things happen from time to time, and it's not always a bad thing, but [%person#1-I]'m disappointed with our conduct today
STR-1:

KEY-508279: [%person#1-surname]: Refereeing was weak
STR-1:

KEY-508280: [%person#1-I] think the weak officiating certainly contributed. A stronger referee would have gotten a handle on things much earlier but instead the match got out of hand a bit
STR-1:

KEY-508281: [%person#1-surname] claims [%team#1-short] were 'targeted' by [%person#referee-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508282: [%person#1-I] felt we were being targeted. If you look at the cards in isolation there were more than a few harsh decisions and that doesn't happen by accident. It's either deliberate or incompetent but, either way, it's unacceptable
STR-1:

KEY-508283: [%person#2] claimed that the referee let [%person#1-your] game get out of hand. Do [%person#1-you] share that opinion?
STR-1:

KEY-508284: That's not something [%person#1-I]'m going to get involved in
STR-1:

KEY-508285: [%person#1-surname]: Refereeing wasn't great
STR-1:

KEY-508286: The refereeing certainly wasn't great and, when that happens, you tend to see things run a little bit amok
STR-1:

KEY-508287: [%person#1-surname] sides with [%person#2-surname] after card fest
STR-1:

KEY-508288: [%person#1-I] can see why [%person#2-he]'s frustrated; [%person#1-I] would be too
STR-1:

KEY-508289: [%person#2-surname] 'should control [%person#2-his] players, says [%person#1-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508290: If [%person#2-he] doesn't want to be punished, [%person#2-he] should control [%person#2-his] players
STR-1:

KEY-508291: [%person#2-surname] 'out of line' for blaming referee
STR-1:

KEY-508292: [%person#2-He] was way out of line blaming the officials. [%person#2-He] only has [%person#2-his] players to blame
STR-1:

KEY-508293: [%person#2] seems to think [%person#1-you] only have [%person#1-your] players to blame for their lack of discipline. Is that fair?
STR-1:

KEY-508294: [%person#1-I] want to leave this well alone now
STR-1:

KEY-508295: With the benefit of hindsight [%person#1-I]'ll have to admit that we didn't maintain our usual level of composure and we let things get away from us
STR-1:

KEY-508296: [%person#1-surname] backs down over criticism of officials
STR-1:

KEY-508297: [%person#1-I] was a tad overzealous in the heat of the moment. [%person#1-I] don't think we helped ourselves but there were lots of factors in play
STR-1:

KEY-508298: [%person#1-surname]: [%person#2-surname] is wrong
STR-1:

KEY-508299: [%person#2-He]'s wrong. Look at our record; does this seem normal or fair?
STR-1:

KEY-508300: [%person#1-surname] piles pressure on officials as controversy intensifies
STR-1:

KEY-508301: [%person#1-I]'m 100% sure that this is all about the officials and nothing to do with us, and [%person#1-I] won't allow our good reputation to be tarnished like this
STR-1:

KEY-508302: After a refereeing performance that will generate plenty of discussion, how do [%person#1-you] think it reflects on the standards of officiating in [%nation#1]?
STR-1:

KEY-508303: Are you trying to put words in [%person#1-my] mouth?
STR-1:

KEY-508304: [%person#1-surname] backs referees
STR-1:

KEY-508305: If we're going to go down that road then [%person#1-I] want to express [%person#1-my] support for the officials. They do a thankless task and, most of the time, they get it spot-on
STR-1:

KEY-508306: [%person#1-surname] doesn't want to use officials as excuse
STR-1: [%person#1-surname] không muốn lấy các quan chức làm cái cớ

KEY-508307: Using the officials as an excuse is so lazy and [%person#1-I]'m tired of it. [%person#1-I]'d rather focus on [%person#1-my] team
STR-1:

KEY-508308: [%person#1-surname] wants conversation about officiating standards
STR-1:

KEY-508309: [%person#1-I]'m sure we all have our opinions and it's about time we had a collective conversation where everyone has a chance to be heard. It's the only way forward
STR-1:

KEY-508310: [%person#1-surname]: Standards of officiating are declining
STR-1:

KEY-508311: The quality and standard of refereeing has been declining for so long now that we've just sort of accepted it. We can and must do better
STR-1:

KEY-508312: [%person#2] has claimed that the standard of refereeing in [%nation#1] is not good. Do [%person#1-you] agree?
STR-1:

KEY-508313: This isn't the time to have that debate
STR-1:

KEY-508314: [%person#1-surname]: Our referees do a great job
STR-1:

KEY-508315: [%person#1-I] really don't agree with that; our referees do a great job in challenging circumstances and we should be proud of that
STR-1:

KEY-508316: [%person#1-surname] wants more support for referees
STR-1:

KEY-508317: We need more support for our referees. It's a very hard job and we're all too quick to criticise them when things go wrong
STR-1:

KEY-508318: [%person#1-surname] shares [%person#2-surname]{s} frustrations over officiating
STR-1:

KEY-508319: [%person#1-I] can certainly see where [%person#2-he]'s coming from; it can definitely be frustrating when bad decisions are made against [%person#1-your] team
STR-1:

KEY-508320: [%person#1-surname] laments standard of refereeing
STR-1:

KEY-508321: It really is lamentable these days. We all work so hard at our craft and it can't be acceptable to have sub-standard officiating at this level
STR-1:

KEY-508322: With [%person#2] supportive of [%person#1-your] criticism of refereeing standards, are [%person#1-you] hopeful of being able to drive meaningful change?
STR-1:

KEY-508323: Let's see what happens
STR-1:

KEY-508324: [%person#1-surname] doubts refereeing will change
STR-1:

KEY-508325: [%person#1-I]'m hardly the first manager to talk about this, and [%person#1-I] won't be the last. Nothing ever changes
STR-1:

KEY-508326: [%person#1-surname] 'powerless' to improve standard of officiating
STR-1:

KEY-508327: [%person#1-I] can talk all day long but [%person#1-I]'m ultimately powerless. The change needs to come from the very top
STR-1:

KEY-508328: [%person#1-surname] wants support to improve refereeing
STR-1:

KEY-508329: [%person#1-I] appreciate [%person#2-his] support and we need a lot more if we're going to be heard
STR-1:

KEY-508330: [%person#1-surname] wants to keep pressure on officials
STR-1:

KEY-508331: [%person#1-I]'m glad that others are willing to speak out. We have to collectively keep the pressure up if things are going to change
STR-1:

KEY-508332: [%person#2] doesn't quite share [%person#1-your] criticism of the refereeing standards in [%nation#1]. Are [%person#1-you] perhaps fighting a losing battle?
STR-1:

KEY-508333: Let's talk about something else instead
STR-1:

KEY-508334: [%person#1-surname] accepts defeat in refereeing controversy
STR-1:

KEY-508335: [%person#1-I] suspect that [%person#1-my] claims have fallen on deaf ears so [%person#1-I] might have to accept defeat
STR-1:

KEY-508336: [%person#1-surname] 'not surprised' by [%person#2-surname]{s} lack of support
STR-1:

KEY-508337: [%person#1-I]'m not really surprised that [%person#2-he] wasn't willing to lend [%person#2-his] support, it's not easy to rage against the machine
STR-1:

KEY-508338: [%person#1-surname] will continue to fight for change
STR-1:

KEY-508339: [%person#1-I] don't need [%person#2-his] support. [%person#1-I]'m determined to fight for change that benefits everyone
STR-1:

KEY-508340: [%person#1-surname] happy to be 'lone voice' seeking improvement in officiating
STR-1:

KEY-508341: If [%person#1-I] have to do this [%person#1-myself] and be a lone voice, so be it, it's too important to not press on with
STR-1:

KEY-508342: There was a flashpoint today when VAR intervened to correct referee [%person#referee]. Do [%person#1-you] think it was the right decision?
STR-1:

KEY-508343: It doesn't matter what [%person#1-I] think
STR-1:

KEY-508344: [%person#1-surname]: VAR works
STR-1:

KEY-508345: Yes, it was. That's why we have VAR and this was a perfect demonstration of how to use it
STR-1:

KEY-508346: [%person#1-surname] backs VAR intervention
STR-1:

KEY-508347: [%person#1-I] think it showed all the benefits to having video review. If you're not sure, have a second look, and make sure you get it right
STR-1:

KEY-508348: [%person#1-surname] unsure about VAR intervention
STR-1:

KEY-508349: [%person#1-I] don't know that it was right and [%person#1-I]'m disappointed with the outcome
STR-1:

KEY-508350: [%person#1-surname] fumes at VAR intervention
STR-1:

KEY-508351: [%person#1-I]'m at a loss for words. What did they see on video to come up with that decision?!
STR-1:

KEY-508352: What did [%person#1-you] make of the decision by VAR to correct the referee's decision without [%person#referee-him] looking at the pitchside monitor?
STR-1:

KEY-508353: It's not really any of [%person#1-my] business
STR-1:

KEY-508354: [%person#1-surname]: VAR monitor is unnecessary
STR-1:

KEY-508355: Looking at the monitor for everything would make these decisions take even longer, something none of us want, so [%person#1-I]'m entirely fine with it
STR-1:

KEY-508356: [%person#1-surname]: Use VAR monitor sparingly
STR-1:

KEY-508357: [%person#1-I] think they should only go to the screen when they really need to, not as a matter of course, and there was no need for it here
STR-1:

KEY-508358: [%person#1-surname] wants increased use of VAR monitor
STR-1:

KEY-508359: If the option is there for the referee to take a closer look, and it means we get the right decision, surely we should be doing it?
STR-1:

KEY-508360: [%person#1-surname] describes VAR as 'a complete mess'
STR-1:

KEY-508361: The entire process is a complete mess. We've got officials in a room somewhere miles away making decisions while the on-pitch officials don't look at the same footage themselves. It's ridiculous!
STR-1:

KEY-508362: VAR was used to correct referee [%person#referee] today but, upon closer inspection, it appears to have made the wrong decision. What was [%person#1-your] view of the incident?
STR-1:

KEY-508363: [%person#1-I] don't know what to make of it
STR-1:

KEY-508364: [%person#1-surname] sympathises with VAR officials
STR-1:

KEY-508365: [%person#1-I]'m incredibly sympathetic towards the officials; these are really hard decisions to get right and we should remember that
STR-1:

KEY-508366: [%person#1-surname]: We'll never get 100% of decisions right
STR-1:

KEY-508367: We'll never get 100% of decisions right so [%person#1-I] think everyone has to be realistic in their expectations here
STR-1:

KEY-508368: [%person#1-surname]: Not a good look for VAR
STR-1:

KEY-508369: It was not a good look for the VAR process and they've got some kinks to still work out
STR-1:

KEY-508370: 'Too much at stake to be wrong' says [%person#1-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508371: It can't be allowed to happen. There's too much at stake for the officials to just get things wrong like this
STR-1:

KEY-508372: We saw VAR intervene in an incident the referee [%person#referee-himself] didn't see. What did [%person#1-you] think?
STR-1:

KEY-508373: Isn't that what it's there for?
STR-1:

KEY-508374: [%person#1-surname] praises VAR intervention
STR-1:

KEY-508375: [%person#1-I] thought it was a perfect demonstration of why we're using video review
STR-1:

KEY-508376: [%person#1-surname]: VAR did its job
STR-1:

KEY-508377: It clearly did its job. We can't expect the officials on the pitch to see everything
STR-1:

KEY-508378: [%person#1-surname] wants answers from referee
STR-1:

KEY-508379: The question nobody seems to be asking is why the referee didn't see it? Surely that's the bigger issue here?
STR-1:

KEY-508380: [%person#1-surname]: Where do we draw VAR line?
STR-1:

KEY-508381: [%person#1-I] didn't like it; once you start taking decisions away from the officials on the field of play, you create a precedent. Where do you draw the line?
STR-1:

KEY-508382: There was controversy when VAR was unable to intervene in an incident unseen by the referee. What was [%person#1-your] opinion on that?
STR-1:

KEY-508383: [%person#1-I] didn't even see it [%person#1-myself]!
STR-1:

KEY-508384: [%person#1-surname] unfussed by VAR controversy
STR-1:

KEY-508385: These things happen, [%person#1-I] won't lose any sleep over it
STR-1:

KEY-508386: [%person#1-surname] on 'unfortunate' VAR incident
STR-1:

KEY-508387: [%person#1-I] think it was unfortunate but nothing more. Nobody set out to incite controversy
STR-1:

KEY-508388: [%person#1-surname] saw 'unseen' incident
STR-1:

KEY-508389: [%person#1-I] saw it, plenty of other people did, so why can't VAR intervene there? It's getting silly
STR-1:

KEY-508390: [%person#1-surname]: We must expect more of our officials
STR-1:

KEY-508391: It's inexcusable really. We have to expect more of the officials otherwise these mistakes will cost people their jobs
STR-1:

KEY-508392: We saw VAR confirm a controversial decision made by [%person#referee] today. Did [%person#1-you] agree with the outcome?
STR-1:

KEY-508393: It doesn't matter what [%person#1-I] think
STR-1:

KEY-508394: [%person#1-surname]: Everyone got key decision right
STR-1:

KEY-508395: Yeah, no arguments here
STR-1:

KEY-508396: [%person#1-surname]: Officials did their job
STR-1:

KEY-508397: The officials followed procedure and ensured the right decision was made. Fair enough
STR-1:

KEY-508398: [%person#1-surname] disagrees with controversial decision
STR-1:

KEY-508399: [%person#1-I] don't think they got it right but it's a big late for [%person#1-me] to complain about it now
STR-1:

KEY-508400: [%person#1-surname]: Referees will always back each other
STR-1:

KEY-508401: [%person#1-I]'ve been suspicious about VAR for a while. Referees will always back each other, even more so when the margins are fine, and they're not making the right decision as a result of that
STR-1:

KEY-508402: It took a long time for VAR to make a decision earlier in the match. Were [%person#1-you] okay with that?
STR-1:

KEY-508403: [%person#1-My] opinion really doesn't matter here
STR-1:

KEY-508404: [%person#1-surname]: Right decision must be made
STR-1:

KEY-508405: It doesn't matter how long it takes if we get the right decision. That's what we're all looking for
STR-1:

KEY-508406: [%person#1-surname]: Officials have to be sure
STR-1:

KEY-508407: The officials have to be sure and, if that takes a little bit of time every now and then, that's alright
STR-1:

KEY-508408: [%person#1-surname] 'frustrated' by lengthy VAR stoppage
STR-1:

KEY-508409: It's frustrating as it kills the momentum of the match and it can be really hard for the players to get going again
STR-1:

KEY-508410: [%person#1-surname] says VAR is 'killing' the game
STR-1:

KEY-508411: VAR, and the length of time it takes to make decisions, is killing the game as a spectacle. [%person#1-I] feel for the fans in the stands, it must be terrible to watch
STR-1:

KEY-508412: Once again, we've seen VAR correct a refereeing decision. What do [%person#1-you] think about things now
STR-1:

KEY-508413: Whatever [%person#1-I] said last time still stands
STR-1:

KEY-508414: [%person#1-surname] still supports VAR
STR-1:

KEY-508415: [%person#1-I]'m still supportive of VAR and [%person#1-I] can't see that changing
STR-1:

KEY-508416: [%person#1-surname]: Continue to back officials
STR-1:

KEY-508417: There's so much controversy around VAR, even now, and [%person#1-I] want to make sure we back our officials because they're doing a good job in tough circumstances
STR-1:

KEY-508418: [%person#1-surname] wants VAR answers
STR-1:

KEY-508419: [%person#1-I]'m still looking for clear answers on why VAR intervenes. There needs to be full accountability
STR-1:

KEY-508420: [%person#1-surname] angry at latest VAR intervention
STR-1:

KEY-508421: [%person#1-I]'ve said it before and [%person#1-I]'ll say it again; VAR should be scrapped
STR-1:

KEY-508422: [%person#2] has once again hit out against VAR after the latest controversial incident. Do [%person#1-you] agree with [%person#2-him]?
STR-1:

KEY-508423: [%person#1-I] don't want to get involved
STR-1:

KEY-508424: [%person#1-surname] backs [%person#2-surname] in VAR criticism
STR-1:

KEY-508425: [%person#1-I] think he's right. VAR in its current guise isn't fit for purpose
STR-1:

KEY-508426: [%person#1-surname]: [%person#2-surname] has a point
STR-1:

KEY-508427: [%person#2-He]'s got a point. It appears at times as if nobody really knows what's going on
STR-1:

KEY-508428: [%person#1-surname]: [%person#2-surname] should back off VAR criticism
STR-1:

KEY-508429: [%person#1-I] reckon [%person#2-he]'s gone a bit too far and should back off. Everyone's trying their best
STR-1:

KEY-508430: [%person#1-surname]: [%person#2-surname] is wrong on VAR
STR-1:

KEY-508431: VAR works and, if [%person#2-surname] can't see that, [%person#2]'s wrong
STR-1:

KEY-508432: [%person#2] has been critical of [%person#1-your] stance on VAR. Do [%person#1-you] have a response to [%person#2-his] comments?
STR-1:

KEY-508433: [%person#1-I] haven't got time for this
STR-1:

KEY-508434: [%person#1-surname] appreciates [%person#2-surname]{s} honesty
STR-1:

KEY-508435: [%person#1-I] bear no ill will towards [%person#2-him] and appreciate [%person#2-his] honesty
STR-1:

KEY-508436: [%person#1-surname] admits [%person#2-surname] right on VAR
STR-1:

KEY-508437: [%person#1-I] think [%person#2-he]'s probably right on balance, but it's hard to see that when [%person#1-you]'re frustrated immediately post-match
STR-1:

KEY-508438: [%person#1-surname]: [%person#2-surname] should mind [%person#2-his] business
STR-1:

KEY-508439: [%person#2-He] should mind [%person#2-his] business, this has nothing to do with [%person#2-him]
STR-1:

KEY-508440: [%person#1-surname] stands by VAR criticism
STR-1:

KEY-508441: [%person#1-I]'ve been given no reason to back down from [%person#1-my] comments. If anything, [%person#1-I] believe in them even more passionately
STR-1:

KEY-508442: [%person#2] has come out in support of [%person#1-your] criticism of VAR. Is it helpful to have that in times like these?
STR-1:

KEY-508443: [%person#1-I]'m not sure if it makes very much of a difference to be honest
STR-1:

KEY-508444: [%person#1-surname] values [%person#2-surname]{s} support
STR-1:

KEY-508445: [%person#1-I] value [%person#2-his] support incredibly. If more managers speak out then we might make some real progress
STR-1:

KEY-508446: [%person#1-surname] hopes more managers reconsider VAR stance
STR-1:

KEY-508447: [%person#1-I] hope it's just the beginning. We need proper backing if we're going to get anywhere
STR-1:

KEY-508448: [%person#1-surname]: [%person#2-surname] jumping on bandwagon
STR-1:

KEY-508449: [%person#2-He]'s just jumping on the bandwagon before being left behind
STR-1:

KEY-508450: [%person#1-surname]: Where was [%person#2-surname]{s} support before?
STR-1:

KEY-508451: Where was this support when it happened before? It's no good speaking out after the fact, the damage has already been done
STR-1:

KEY-508452: Once again, we've seen VAR correct a refereeing decision without the officials looking at the pitchside monitor. What do [%person#1-you] think about things now
STR-1:

KEY-508453: [%person#1-surname] still supports VAR process
STR-1:

KEY-508454: [%person#1-I] still don't believe you need to check everything on the monitor. Doing so would be a waste of time
STR-1:

KEY-508455: It's a discussion that doesn't even need to be had. If we back the officials, who are there to do the job they're trained for, then there won't be any problems
STR-1:

KEY-508456: [%person#1-I]'m still looking for an answer as to why the monitor isn't used consistently. Does anyone know?
STR-1:

KEY-508457: [%person#1-surname] angry at latest VAR development
STR-1:

KEY-508458: [%person#2] has once again hit out against VAR after the latest controversial incident. Do [%person#1-you] agree with [%person#2-him] about pitchside monitor use?
STR-1:

KEY-508459: [%person#1-I] think [%person#2-he]'s spot on. You can't pick and choose when to use the monitor. There has to be consistency
STR-1:

KEY-508460: [%person#2-He]'s got a point; whether this is the best way to make it isn't up to [%person#1-me], but we shouldn't ignore [%person#2-him]
STR-1:

KEY-508461: [%person#1-I] wouldn't be as outspoken about the pitchside reviews as this and [%person#2-he] would be well-advised to back off a little
STR-1:

KEY-508462: [%person#2-He]'s wrong here [%person#1-I]'m afraid. The rules are clear enough for [%person#1-me] to understand
STR-1:

KEY-508463: [%person#2] has been critical of [%person#1-your] stance on VAR. Do [%person#1-you] have a response to [%person#2-his] comments about pitchside monitors?
STR-1:

KEY-508464: [%person#2] has come out in support of [%person#1-your] criticism of VAR and pitchside monitor use. Is it helpful to have that in times like these?
STR-1:

KEY-508465: Once again, we've seen VAR incorrectly overrule the referee on the pitch. What do [%person#1-you] think about things now
STR-1:

KEY-508466: [%person#1-I] still think VAR is worth having; it won't get everything right, and we need to accept that
STR-1:

KEY-508467: Can someone please explain why this is still allowed to happen? Nobody has so far and it's becoming ridiculous
STR-1:

KEY-508468: [%person#1-surname] angry at latest VAR mistake
STR-1:

KEY-508469: [%person#1-I]'m extremely angry and [%person#1-I] don't understand why more people aren't. It's ruining football for [%person#1-me]
STR-1:

KEY-508470: [%person#2] has once again hit out against VAR after the latest instance of it intervening only to get the decision wrong. Do [%person#1-you] agree with [%person#2-him]?
STR-1:

KEY-508471: [%person#1-I]'m 100% on [%person#2-his] side. We cannot tolerate this sort of mistake anymore
STR-1:

KEY-508472: It's unprofessional and it's ruining the product this league works so hard to put on. [%person#2-He] has a point that everyone deserves better
STR-1:

KEY-508473: [%person#1-I] reckon [%person#2-he]'s gone a bit too far and should back off. It's not like [%person#2-he] gets everything right [%person#2-himself]
STR-1:

KEY-508474: [%person#2]'s wrong. That decision wasn't a bad one, far from it
STR-1:

KEY-508475: [%person#2] has been critical of [%person#1-your] stance on VAR's mistakes. Do [%person#1-you] have a response to [%person#2-his] comments?
STR-1:

KEY-508476: [%person#2] has come out in support of [%person#1-your] criticism of VAR following the latest controversial mistake. Is it helpful to have that in times like these?
STR-1:

KEY-508477: It's good to have that sort of support, it means [%person#1-I]'m not going absolutely mad yet
STR-1:

KEY-508478: Hopefully this is the spark everyone else needs to see what's going on. If we all refuse to accept this level of incompetence we can change things for the better
STR-1:

KEY-508479: Once again, we've seen VAR forced to intervene in an incident that went unseen by the officials on the pitch. Is that a good or a bad thing?
STR-1:

KEY-508480: It's just a part of football now
STR-1:

KEY-508481: [%person#1-surname] backs VAR process
STR-1:

KEY-508482: Surely this is exactly why we have VAR? [%person#1-I]'ve said it before, but we have to help our officials, and this is a perfect example of that working
STR-1:

KEY-508483: [%person#1-surname] pleased with VAR situation
STR-1:

KEY-508484: [%person#1-I]'m actually pleased because it shows the system at work properly. It's an extra layer of security to make sure the right decisions are being made
STR-1:

KEY-508485: [%person#1-surname] demands more of on-pitch officials
STR-1:

KEY-508486: Having VAR as a backup might be alright but we need to hold the on-pitch officials to account. How can they miss that?
STR-1:

KEY-508487: [%person#1-surname] angry following latest VAR controversy
STR-1:

KEY-508488: [%person#1-I]'m really angry; we're letting a completely different set of officials exercise authority over something they're not fully involved in. It's a complete mess
STR-1:

KEY-508489: [%person#2] was far from pleased with VAR having to intervene to assist the match officials. What was [%person#1-your] take on things?
STR-1:

KEY-508490: It feels like [%person#1-I] shouldn't really get involved here
STR-1:

KEY-508491: [%person#1-surname] backs [%person#2-surname] in VAR debate
STR-1:

KEY-508492: [%person#2-He]'s right; we need the officials to be better. There's no excuse for missing an incident of that magnitude
STR-1:

KEY-508493: [%person#1-surname] sympathises with [%person#2-surname] as VAR debate rages on
STR-1:

KEY-508494: [%person#1-I] certainly sympathise with [%person#2-him] because VAR is changing the game, and not for the better
STR-1:

KEY-508495: [%person#1-surname] disagrees with [%person#2-surname] on VAR
STR-1:

KEY-508496: [%person#1-I] don't really know where [%person#2-he]'s coming from here. This was VAR as it should be
STR-1:

KEY-508497: [%person#2-surname] 'deluded' in VAR controversy, says [%person#1-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508498: [%person#2-He]'s deluded; these are the ramblings of someone trying to deflect attention away from [%person#2-his] team
STR-1:

KEY-508499: How do [%person#1-you] respond to [%person#2-surname]{s} criticism of [%person#1-your] reaction to the latest VAR controversy?
STR-1:

KEY-508500: [%person#1-I]'m not interested in what [%person#2-he] has to say
STR-1:

KEY-508501: [%person#1-surname] respects [%person#2-surname]{s} opinion
STR-1:

KEY-508502: [%person#1-I] respect [%person#2-his] right to an opinion and [%person#1-I] don't take anything personally
STR-1:

KEY-508503: [%person#1-surname]: [%person#2-surname] probably right on VAR
STR-1:

KEY-508504: [%person#2-He]'s probably right, all things considered, but [%person#1-I] do think we still need to apply pressure on the officials to do better
STR-1:

KEY-508505: [%person#1-surname]: [%person#2-surname] 'scared' to criticise officials
STR-1:

KEY-508506: [%person#2-He]'s too scared to get stuck in and criticise the officials when they deserve it. [%person#1-I] wouldn't expect anything less
STR-1:

KEY-508507: [%person#1-surname] 'lost respect' for [%person#2-surname] over VAR spat
STR-1:

KEY-508508: [%person#1-I] lost respect for [%person#2-him] to tell you the truth. [%person#2-He]'s gone down in [%person#1-my] estimation
STR-1:

KEY-508509: [%person#2] has very much sided with [%person#1-you] over recent VAR criticism. Can the pair of you press home [%person#1-your] point?
STR-1:

KEY-508510: We'll have to wait and see, really
STR-1:

KEY-508511: [%person#1-surname] hopes to help make VAR changes
STR-1:

KEY-508512: [%person#1-I] really hope so; we can't continue with VAR in its current guise, it's ruining the game
STR-1:

KEY-508513: [%person#1-surname] welcomes [%person#2-surname]{s} support
STR-1:

KEY-508514: [%person#1-I] think we need as much support as we can get if we're to be heard so [%person#1-I] welcome [%person#2-his] comments
STR-1:

KEY-508515: [%person#2-surname] 'too late' to help, says [%person#1-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508516: It would've been better had [%person#2-he] spoken out earlier. It's a bit late now
STR-1:

KEY-508517: [%person#1-surname] 'doesn't want [%person#1-surname]{s} support
STR-1:

KEY-508518: [%person#1-I] don't want [%person#2-his] support, simple as that
STR-1:

KEY-508519: We saw the latest example of VAR not being allowed to get involved in an incident that went unseen by the on-pitch officials. What do [%person#1-you] think about that?
STR-1:

KEY-508520: It'd be better if [%person#1-I] kept [%person#1-my] thoughts to [%person#1-myself]
STR-1:

KEY-508521: [%person#1-surname] refuses to dwell on latest VAR controversy
STR-1:

KEY-508522: [%person#1-I] can't afford to dwell on it. It's happened, the rules are the rules, and we have to move on from the debate
STR-1:

KEY-508523: [%person#1-surname] focused on [%team#1-short] rather than officials
STR-1:

KEY-508524: [%person#1-My] job is to manage [%team#1-short] to the best of [%person#1-my] ability and that's where [%person#1-my] focus is now
STR-1:

KEY-508525: [%person#1-surname]: VAR pointless if it can't intervene
STR-1:

KEY-508526: Look, if VAR can't get involved in something that important when the officials don't see it, it's utterly pointless. Surely everyone can see that?
STR-1:

KEY-508527: [%person#1-surname]: Time to scrap VAR
STR-1:

KEY-508528: If we're talking about incidents where, despite having however many officials involved they can't make a decision, then it's time to scrap VAR altogether. If not, we're all wasting our time
STR-1:

KEY-508529: [%person#2] was far from pleased with VAR not being allowed when the officials failed to see an incident that has caused some controversy. What was [%person#1-your] take on things?
STR-1:

KEY-508530: [%person#2-He]'s right. If VAR cannot get involved there, why are we bothering?
STR-1:

KEY-508531: [%person#1-I] have to sympathise really; it doesn't seem like the powers that be know what they're doing with VAR
STR-1:

KEY-508532: It might be frustrating, but the rules are clear, and they're the same for everyone
STR-1:

KEY-508533: [%person#1-I]'ll concede to [%person#2-him] being right in general, but we need better rules on VAR overall, for everyone's benefit
STR-1:

KEY-508534: Did you agree with VAR in confirming [%person#referee]{s} decision today?
STR-1:

KEY-508535: What [%person#1-I] think doesn't matter
STR-1:

KEY-508536: [%person#1-surname]: We've seen that VAR works
STR-1:

KEY-508537: This shouldn't be a talking point; this was VAR working properly
STR-1:

KEY-508538: [%person#1-surname]: Good to see officials working in sync
STR-1:

KEY-508539: [%person#1-I] thought it was really good to see the officials here and in the VAR nerve centre working in sync. It gives us all confidence in them
STR-1:

KEY-508540: [%person#1-surname]: Officials will always back each other
STR-1:

KEY-508541: [%person#1-I]'m of the opinion that officials will always have each other's backs, regardless of the decision they need to make
STR-1:

KEY-508542: [%person#1-surname] believes VAR got it wrong
STR-1:

KEY-508543: [%person#1-I] can't be the only person who thinks VAR got it wrong and should have changed the decision?
STR-1:

KEY-508544: Do [%person#1-you] agree with [%person#2]{s} rather incendiary view that the VAR officials were wrong to back up the decisions made by the on-pitch officials?
STR-1:

KEY-508545: It's not for [%person#1-me] to say
STR-1:

KEY-508546: [%person#1-surname] backs [%person#2-surname] over VAR
STR-1:

KEY-508547: [%person#1-I] think [%person#2-he]{s} right; there isn't nearly enough scrutiny of the entire process
STR-1:

KEY-508548: We saw yet another example of VAR taking a long time to adjudicate on an incident. Do [%person#1-you] think changes are needed?
STR-1:

KEY-508549: [%person#1-I] don't have an opinion either way
STR-1:

KEY-508550: [%person#1-surname]: Time no problem in VAR decision process
STR-1:

KEY-508551: Why should time be a factor? If they make the right decision, they can take as long as they need to
STR-1:

KEY-508552: [%person#1-surname] calls for VAR patience
STR-1:

KEY-508553: We all need to be patient, not just in general, but whenever VAR needs to make a check. These decisions really don't take all that long to make
STR-1:

KEY-508554: [%person#1-surname] demands quicker VAR decisions
STR-1:

KEY-508555: The fans in the stands absolutely hate it; every second they're left waiting for a decision kills the atmosphere and interest in the action. It has to be done quicker
STR-1:

KEY-508556: [%person#1-surname]: VAR will kill football
STR-1:

KEY-508557: [%person#1-I] don't think it's being melodramatic to say that it'll kill football if it carries on like this. The wait is excruciating for everyone involved
STR-1:

KEY-508558: Do [%person#1-you] agree with [%person#2] in [%person#2-his] belief that many VAR decisions take too long to make?
STR-1:

KEY-508559: [%person#1-surname] backs [%person#2-surname] in VAR debate
STR-1:

KEY-508560: Yes, absolutely. These decisions are taking far too long
STR-1:

KEY-508561: [%person#1-I] can certainly see where [%person#2-he]'s coming from. There are surely improvements they could make to speed things up?
STR-1:

KEY-508562: [%person#1-surname] questions 'impatient' [%person#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508563: It's just a question of patience to [%person#1-me]. Maybe [%person#2-he]'s just impatient?
STR-1:

KEY-508564: [%person#1-surname] tells [%person#2-surname] 'the right decision must be reached'
STR-1:

KEY-508565: The whole thing boils down to this: the right decision must be reached, and it doesn't matter how long that takes
STR-1:

KEY-508566: How frustrating is it, after being so critical of VAR in general, to once again find [%person#1-yourself] on the wrong end of another disputed outcome?
STR-1:

KEY-508567: [%person#1-I] know what'll happen if [%person#1-I] speak [%person#1-my] mind so [%person#1-I]'ll sit this one out
STR-1:

KEY-508568: [%person#1-surname] 'can't do anything' about latest VAR controversy
STR-1:

KEY-508569: [%person#1-I] can't do anything about it so [%person#1-I] have to let it go
STR-1:

KEY-508570: [%person#1-surname]: We know what VAR is by now
STR-1:

KEY-508571: Look, we know what VAR is by now, and we have to get by as best we can. There's no further point in crying about things, it won't achieve anything
STR-1:

KEY-508572: [%person#1-surname] 'lost for words' as VAR strikes [%team#1-short] again
STR-1:

KEY-508573: [%person#1-I]'m really lost for words. [%person#1-I] don't know what to say anymore
STR-1:

KEY-508574: [%person#1-surname] prepared to face punishment for VAR comments
STR-1:

KEY-508575: [%person#1-I]'m prepared to face whatever punishments come [%person#1-my] way for saying this, but it's beyond a joke now, and people have to lose their jobs for this incompetence
STR-1:

KEY-508576: What do [%person#1-you] make of [%person#2]{s} reaction to VAR once again coming out against [%person#2-his] [%team#2-short] team?
STR-1:

KEY-508577: There are no team rivalries here; if a decision is wrong, it's wrong, and it'll eventually affect us all. [%person#2-He]'s right
STR-1:

KEY-508578: [%person#1-You]'ve generally been supportive of VAR but this time came out on the wrong end of a controversial decision. Does that give [%person#1-you] pause for thought?
STR-1:

KEY-508579: [%person#1-I] hadn't really considered it like that
STR-1:

KEY-508580: [%person#1-surname] backs VAR despite controversial decision
STR-1:

KEY-508581: Yeah, of course, decisions are going to against us from time to time because that's the nature of the business. As long as those decisions are right, it's fine
STR-1:

KEY-508582: [%person#1-surname] continues to support VAR process
STR-1:

KEY-508583: It's tough when anything goes against us but it doesn't mean [%person#1-I]'ll suddenly become a VAR critic. That would be stupid
STR-1:

KEY-508584: [%person#1-surname] reconsiders VAR stance
STR-1:

KEY-508585: [%person#1-I]'m not saying [%person#1-I]'m suddenly converted but it definitely makes [%person#1-me] reconsider things
STR-1:

KEY-508586: [%person#1-surname] turns against VAR as [%team#1-short] suffer
STR-1:

KEY-508587: [%person#1-I] don't think anyone can pretend that we haven't been done over; VAR has got that one wrong and [%person#1-I] can't accept that
STR-1:

KEY-508588: Were [%person#1-you] surprised to hear [%person#2] hit out against VAR having previously been supportive of the technology?
STR-1:

KEY-508589: [%person#1-I] really don't care about it
STR-1:

KEY-508590: [%person#1-surname] backs [%person#2-surname] as VAR debate takes unlikely turn
STR-1:

KEY-508591: [%person#1-I] was a little taken aback, sure, but [%person#2-he]'s right. Everyone feels the pain of VAR eventually
STR-1:

KEY-508592: [%person#1-surname]: [%person#2-surname] was always going to turn against VAR
STR-1:

KEY-508593: [%person#1-I] thought it'd happen sooner! [%person#2-He] was always going to turn against VAR and start questioning things, it was just a matter of time
STR-1:

KEY-508594: [%person#1-surname] says [%person#2-surname] 'embarrassing' over VAR U-turn
STR-1:

KEY-508595: It's pretty embarrassing for [%person#2-him] and shows [%person#2-his] true colours
STR-1:

STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-508598: Do [%person#1-you] not think it's unfair to continue criticising VAR when it's clear they've been getting decisions correct? It's happened here again today and people are expecting a certain response from [%person#1-you] as a result

STR-1:

KEY-508603: [%person#1-I] probably have to admit that [%person#1-I]'ve gone too far in being critical and [%person#1-I]'ll have to be more considerate now
STR-1:

KEY-508604: [%person#1-surname]: VAR still not fit for purpose
STR-1:

KEY-508605: It's a system that still isn't fit for purpose and [%person#1-I] won't let it drop until we get the quality we deserve
STR-1:

KEY-508606: [%person#1-surname] doubts VAR decisions yet again
STR-1:

KEY-508611: [%person#1-surname] refuses to condemn critical [%person#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508612: Let's not get into a war of words here; [%person#2-his] opinion is a perfectly valid one
STR-1:

KEY-508613: [%person#1-surname] not surprised by critical [%person#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-508614: Let's just say that [%person#1-I] don't think any of us are surprised by this and leave it at that
STR-1:

KEY-508615: 'Give it a rest', [%person#1-surname] tells [%person#2-surname]

STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-508618: [%person#2-He]'s been really harshly treated, but that's the life of a manager, unfortunately
STR-1:

KEY-508619: If [%person#2-he]'s not doing [%person#2-his] job then [%person#2-he] probably has to go
STR-1:

KEY-508620: The fans clearly felt that [%person#1-you] should have taken [%male#2] off today. Why did [%person#1-you] leave him out there while he was underperforming?
STR-1:

KEY-508621: If [%person#1-I] thought there was a need to replace him then [%person#1-I]'d have done so
STR-1:

KEY-508622: [%person#1-I] didn't have the options on the bench to change as many things as [%person#1-I] would have liked
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-508631: [%person#1-You]'ve finally found the scoresheet after going [%number#1] league matches without a goal. Is this the start of a turnaround?
STR-1:

KEY-508632: With the news that [%male#2] has submitted a transfer request, will [%person#1-you] actively be looking to sell him or will [%person#1-you] be waiting for the market to come to [%person#1-you]?
STR-1:

KEY-508633: There was some controversy today when VAR awarded a penalty to [%team#2-short]. What are [%person#1-your] thoughts on the incident?

KEY-508640: [%person#1-I] try to focus on what [%person#1-I] can actually control
STR-1:

KEY-508641: [%person#1-I]'m not worried about that. It's commonplace these days, and our players are looked after well
STR-1:

KEY-508642: It's a part of the modern game and we understand that. We try to work with the various national teams to make sure everyone has the right information
STR-1:

KEY-508643: [%person#1-I] do get concerned about it, yeah. We have no control over it but could potentially have to change our plans at a moment's notice
STR-1:

KEY-508644: [%person#1-I]'d be more than happy to get rid of international football entirely. It causes us more problems with each passing season

STR-1:

KEY-508651: He's back and available, yes
STR-1:

KEY-508652: He shoud be fine, yeah. He's a bit tired but that's par for the course these days
STR-1:

KEY-508653: [%person#1-I] don't think he'll play; these long-haul flights don't help anyone, and it's always the clubs that suffer
STR-1:

KEY-508654: He's out, he's jetlagged, and [%person#1-I]'m far from happy with the scheduling of this match or the situation as a whole
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-508660: [%person#1-I] haven't got the time for that today
STR-1:

KEY-508661: [%person#1-I] just think the clubs need better protection. We invest so much in these players yet we don't have full control over where they go and what they do for their countries
STR-1:

KEY-508662: It's a scheduling issue. Perhaps there could be a rethink as to when the matches are played so clubs aren't unduly impacted
STR-1:

KEY-508663: [%person#1-I] think we need to make big changes that put the clubs first
STR-1:

KEY-508664: Internationals are absolutely pointless and [%person#1-I]'m baffled that people still care about them
STR-1:

KEY-508665: [%male#2] is, as [%person#1-you]'re well aware, is very gifted technically. How much does that help [%person#1-you] in the way [%person#1-you] set up [%person#1-your] team?

KEY-508674: [%person#1-I] know what he can do, but [%person#1-I]'m more interested in finding out just how much more he can do
STR-1:

KEY-508675: [%male#2], as [%person#1-you]'re well aware, has physical attributes rarely seen in other players. How much does that help [%person#1-you] in the way [%person#1-you] set up [%person#1-your] team?

STR-1:

KEY-508683: [%person#1-I] love what he's been able to do, but there's always that next step where you ask 'can he do more?', and hopefully the answer is yes
STR-1:

KEY-508684: [%male#2] has the intangible qualities so many players look for in a leader. How much does that help [%person#1-you] in the way [%person#1-you] set up [%person#1-your] team?

STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-508688: [%person#1-I] think we rely on him as a team and that's not about to change
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-508702: [%person#1-I] understand that sort of thinking but [%person#1-my] aim is to always try to develop players to become as well rounded as they can possibly be
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-508721: [%person#1-I] don't think [%person#1-my] opinion matters. Players are questioned all the time and it's up to him to prove the doubters wrong
STR-1:

KEY-508722: [%person#1-I] think players always need to be able to adapt and improve, and [%male#2-first] is no different

KEY-521745: [%person#2-You]'re just making excuses now, and bad ones at that.

KEY-521746: I think I was doing a good job.

KEY-521756: That's just football at the end of the day. This feels unfair.
STR-1: Cuối cùng thì nó cũng chỉ là bóng đá thôi, điều này thật không công bằng!

KEY-521757: There's no way I deserved to lose the captaincy though.
STR-1: Không đời nào, mặc dù tôi xứng đáng mất nó.

KEY-521758: I think a captain is meant to be involved in sorting out disputes between players though.
STR-1: Tôi nghĩ một người đội trưởng thì cần phải đứng ra giải quyết các mâu thuẫn giữa các cầu thủ

KEY-521759: I was doing what a captain does. That's no reason to take the armband away.
STR-1: Tôi đã làm những việc của một người đội trưởng. Không có lí do nào để bỏ tấm băng đó đi.

KEY-521760: I'm afraid I really can't agree with that assessment.

STR-1: Bầu không khí có vấn đề gì à? [%person#2-You] hiểu nó sai, quá sai.

KEY-521766: I don't think this decision will help anything, it doesn't make any sense.
STR-1: Tôi không nghĩ quyết định này sẽ giúp ích được gì cả, nó quá vô dụng.

KEY-521767: To be honest [%person#2-you]'ve only made things worse for [%person#2-yourself] now.
STR-1: Thành thực mà nói, ông chỉ đang làm mọi chuyện tồi tệ hơn với ngài thôi!

KEY-521768: [%person#2-You] had a fair level of support [%person#2-you] know. Well, [%person#2-you] did before all of this unfolded...
STR-1: [%person#2-You] đã có sự ủng hộ tương đối, [%person#2-you] biết điều đó. Ừm, [%person#2-you] đã có cho đến khi toàn bộ việc này được phơi bày ra...

STR-1: Tôi e rằng tôi phải không đồng ý với [%person#2-you] Tôi đang làm tốt ở đây với các mối quan hệ cá nhân của mình.

KEY-521775: No, that's unfair, and [%person#2-you] know it.

KEY-522017: Alright, I'll be a good team-mate, and forget about this.
STR-1: Được rồi, tôi sẽ là một đồng đội tốt và quên đi chuyện này.

STR-1: Hợp lý.

KEY-522027: I think we could have challenged on all fronts and that that's not an unrealistic ambition to have, that's all.
STR-1: Tôi nghĩ việc tập trung ở tất cả các đấu trường là quá tham vọng và không khả thi, vậy thôi.

KEY-522028: Our [%comp#3-short] performance was not good enough, regardless of what we did in other competitions.
STR-1: Màn trình diễn của chúng ta chưa đủ tốt, dù chuyện gì xảy ra ở các giải đấu khác đi chăng nữa.

KEY-522035: Relegation? What?!
STR-1: Xuống hạng ư? Cái lề...?

KEY-522036: Staying up is really important, obviously, but we should still have done better in the [%comp#3-short].
STR-1: Dĩ nhiên tỉnh táo là rất quan trọng, nhưng chúng ta vẫn cần làm tốt hơn ở[%comp#3-short]

KEY-522037: I think there's a decent argument that we should be focusing more on the [%comp#3-short].
STR-1:

KEY-522038: We should be prioritising the [%comp#3-short].
STR-1: Chúng ta nên dành ưu tiến cho [%comp#3-short]

KEY-522044: We need to be smarter here, we can't just sign a bunch of new players and expect everything to work out.
STR-1: Chúng ta cần phải thông minh hơn, chúng ta không thể chỉ ký hợp đồng với một loạt cầu thủ mới và mong đợi mọi thứ sẽ suôn sẻ.

KEY-522045: This needs precision. Making a few new signings won't do anything to help.
STR-1: Việc này cần sự chính xác. Kí một vài bản hợp đồng mới sẽ không giải quyết được việc gì cả

KEY-522046: I don't think a change of tactic is going to help us right now, however well-intentioned that is.
STR-1: Tôi không nghĩ việc thay đổi về mặt chiến thuật sẽ giúp chúng ta vào lúc này.

KEY-522047: Changing tactics is only going to confuse us even more. How will that help?
STR-1: Thay đổi chiến thuật sẽ chỉ càng làm khó khăn hơn với chúng ta thôi. Làm thế nào mà nó giúp ích được?

KEY-522048: I'm really quite surprised that [%person#2-you]'re so dismissive about this. I didn't expect that.
STR-1: Tôi thực sự khá ngạc nhiên rằng [%person#2-you] lại bác bỏ điều này. Tôi không mong đợi điều đó.

KEY-522049: Why are [%person#2-you] being so dismissive? We all want to succeed, right?
STR-1: Tại sao [%person#2-you] lại xồn xồn như vậy? Tất cả chúng ta đều muốn thành công, phải không?

KEY-522050: Alright, I'll leave it there.
STR-1: Được rồi, tôi sẽ bỏ qua chuyện này.

KEY-522051: I'm not sure why [%person#2-you] think this is all about me? We need to find a way to work together.
STR-1: Tôi không chắc tại sao anh lại nghĩ đấy là về tôi. Chúng ta phải hợp tác

KEY-522052: Stop trying to make this about me. [%person#2-You]'re the manager, [%person#2-you] lead.
STR-1: Đừng đổ lỗi cho tôi nữa. [%person#2-You] là HLV, [%person#2-you] có trách nhiệm dẫn dắt đội.

KEY-522053: Alright, forget I said anything.
STR-1: Vâng, bỏ qua điều tôi vừa nói nhé.

STR-1: Tôi rất bất ngờ và thất vọng về cuộc trò chuyện này, và ai nghe được đều cũng sẽ cảm thấy giống tôi thôi.

KEY-522055: [%person#2-You]'ve shown no interest in helping the team and the rest of the players will surely have something to say about that.
STR-1: [%person#2-You] đã chẳng tỏ ra không quan tâm đến việc giúp đỡ đội và những cầu thủ còn lại chắc chắn sẽ có điều gì đó để nói về điều đó.

KEY-522056: Okay, perhaps it's for the best if we end things there. I'm disappointed we've not been able to work something out.
STR-1: OK, có lẽ tốt nhất là chúng ta nên dừng lại. Tôi thất vọng rằng chúng ta không thể tìm ra giải pháp.

KEY-522057: This is a waste of time, I'm done here.
STR-1: Làm việc như này chỉ phí thời gian. Tôi chán rồi, tôi out

KEY-522058: Alright, fine, I'll drop it.
STR-1:

KEY-522059: I won't be forced out over this so consider this conversation over.
STR-1:

KEY-522060: I guess I'm the only one who really wants what's best for the club. I won't be threatened but I am disappointed.
STR-1:

KEY-522061: Keep threatening me for all I care, it won't work. [%person#2-You] clearly don't want this club to be successful.
STR-1: Hãy cứ tiếp tục đe dọa tôi đi, nó sẽ không làm tôi lung lay đâu. Chắc hẳn là [%person#2-You] không muốn CLB này thành công đâu nhỉ

KEY-522062: I think leaving makes most sense for me now.
STR-1:

KEY-522063: Great, I'm more than happy to leave and find a manager who wants to win.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1: Tuyệt vời, tôi rất vui khi ra đi và tìm được một HLV muốn giành chiến thắng. [%person#2-hidden]

STR-1:

KEY-522065: Why have [%person#2-you] failed to strengthen the squad as [%person#2-you] promised [%person#2-you] would?
STR-1: Tại sao mà ông không thể cải thiện sức mạnh đội hình như lời mà ông đã hứa?

KEY-522066: That's fine, I'm glad to hear it. Thanks!

STR-1: Đừng để tôi thất vọng đấy.

KEY-522068: Alright, I'll say no more.

KEY-522071: I've not got long left on my contract and I've no intention of signing a new one. It's in [%person#2-your] best interests to sell me before I run my deal down.
STR-1: Thời hạn hợp đồng của tôi không còn nhiều, và thú thực mà nói thì tôi không có ý định ký hợp đồng mới đâu. Tốt hơn hết là ông nên tìm cách bán tôi trước khi mà tôi ra đi mà không thu lại được một đồng nào

KEY-522072: I have no intention of staying here, and my contract is running out. I won't sign a new one so [%person#2-you] should probably try to sell me while [%person#2-you] can.
STR-1: Tôi không có ý đinh ở lại đây và hợp đồng của tôi đang hết hạn. Tôi sẽ không tái ký nên anh nên tìm cách bán tôi đi khi anh vẫn còn có thể.

STR-1: Tôi sẽ làm bất cứ điều gì tôi muốn thôi, tôi chỉ nói cho ông biết mà thôi.

KEY-522075: Okay, I'm prepared to wait and see.
STR-1: Ok, tôi sẽ ngồi đây và chờ xem chuyện gì đang xảy ra

KEY-522076: Fine, let's see how things play out.
STR-1: Tốt thôi, hãy xem mọi thứ diễn ra như thế nào.

KEY-522077: I think [%person#2-you]'re making a mistake here, unfortunately.
STR-1: Thật đáng tiếc, tôi nghĩ anh đang phạm phải sai lầm.

KEY-522666: I hate to say it but I fear [%person#2-you] might let me down like [%person#2-you] have before.
STR-1: Tôi ghét phải nói ra điều này nhưng tôi sợ ông làm tôi thất vọng như oong đã từng trước đó.

KEY-522667: I've been let down before and I'm not sure I can trust [%person#2-you] now.
STR-1: Tôi đã rất thất vọng và tôi không chắc tôi có thể tin ông được nữa.

KEY-522668: Can we talk about [%person#2-your] promise of more playing time? It hasn't happened yet and I'm concerned.
STR-1: Chúng ta có thể nói về lời hứa của [%person#2-your] về thời gian chơi nhiều hơn không? Nó vẫn chưa xảy ra và tôi lo ngại.

KEY-522669: What happened to the promise of more playing time? [%person#2-You]'re yet to deliver on it.
STR-1: Điều gì xảy ra với lời hứa được chơi nhiều hơn? Ông vẫn chưa thực hiện nó.

STR-1: Cảm ơn, tôi hy vọng sẽ thấy điều đó xảy ra vào lần này.

KEY-522671: Don't let me down this time.
STR-1: Đừng để tôi thất vọng lần này.

KEY-522672: I apologise if I've caused any problems here, it was never my intention. I'll leave it alone now.
STR-1: Tôi xin lỗi nếu tôi đã gây ra bất kỳ vấn đề nào ở đây, đó không bao giờ là ý định của tôi. Bây giờ tôi sẽ để nó yên.

KEY-522673: Alright, I'll say nothing else about it.
STR-1: Được rồi, tôi không có gì để nói về điều này.

KEY-522674: Fine, I'll drop the matter entirely.
STR-1:

KEY-522676: The board have a responsibility to do what's right for the club and in this case [%person#1-I]'m probably not in a position to argue that they were wrong
STR-1:

KEY-522677: Stick [%person#1-your] neck out; who's going to win the [%award#1] award?
STR-1:

KEY-522678: Can we get [%person#1-your] thoughts on who should win the [%award#1] award?
STR-1:

KEY-522679: What's [%person#1-your] opinion on who should be named [%award#1]?
STR-1:

KEY-522680: Do [%person#1-you] think [%male#2] should be in contention for the [%award#1]?
STR-1:

KEY-522681: [%person#1-I] think he should definitely be in the conversation, he's as worthy as anyone else
STR-1:

KEY-522682: He's playing very well and, if accolades come his way, he'll deserve them
STR-1:

KEY-522683: There's stiff competition but [%male#2-first] certainly has a case to make for himself
STR-1:

KEY-522684: [%person#1-I]'m not concerned about awards, they're out of our control, and [%person#1-my] focus is to challenge him to do even more to impress and take his game to the next level
STR-1:

KEY-522685: How did [%person#1-you] feel upon hearing that [%male#2] had dedicated his [%award#1] win to [%person#2-you]?
STR-1:

KEY-522686: [%person#1-You] must've been proud to hear [%male#2] dedicate winning the [%award#1] to [%person#1-you]?
STR-1:

KEY-522687: [%person#1-surname] proud of [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-522688: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] deserves all the praise
STR-1:

KEY-522689: [%person#1-surname] surprised by [%male#2-surname] gesture
STR-1:

KEY-522690: [%person#1-surname] believes there's more to come from [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-522691: [%person#1-I] don't know what to say, really!
STR-1:

KEY-522692: [%person#1-I] was really touched when he said that; it's very kind of him, and [%person#1-I]'m proud of the way he's playing
STR-1:

KEY-522693: [%person#1-I] am very proud of him, yes, he deserves it and it's nice of him to say that as well
STR-1:

KEY-522694: He deserves all the credit, not [%person#1-me]. It's a very deserved reward for him
STR-1:

KEY-522695: [%person#1-I] didn't do a thing, it's all him. He deserves every credit for the way he's playing
STR-1:

KEY-522696: [%person#1-I] have to admit to being surprised when he came out and said that but [%person#1-I]'m happy for him
STR-1:

KEY-522697: His praise caught [%person#1-me] by surprise! Well done to him though, he deserves it
STR-1:

KEY-522698: [%person#1-I] don't want the recognition for this, it's his award, and there's a lot more to come from him
STR-1:

KEY-522699: It's not about me, it's about him, and now it's about taking his game to even higher levels
STR-1:

KEY-522700: Are [%person#1-you] confident that the [%job#2] shares [%person#1-your] ambitions for the club?
STR-1:

KEY-522701: [%person#1-I] really believe everyone at this club wants to achieve the same objectives and long-term goals. We are all working towards success
STR-1:

KEY-522702: [%person#1-I]'m confident we all want the best for this club. There's regular dialogue and we're aligned when making key decisions
STR-1:

KEY-522703: [%person#1-I] have no doubt we're all working hard, but there are times when we disagree, and it's important to make sure we don't lose sight of the bigger picture
STR-1:

KEY-522704: [%person#1-I] have [%person#1-my] ideas for running this club, the [%job#2] has other ideas, and that's just the way it goes really
STR-1:

KEY-522705: Does [%male#2-surname]{s} signing align with the club's long-term objectives?
STR-1:

KEY-522706: Is [%male#2-surname] a signing that moves the club closer to realising their long-term objectives?
STR-1:

KEY-522707: He's a player who can help us immediately, and hopefully for the foreseeable future
STR-1:

KEY-522708: We want to add quality players like him to this squad to give us the best chance of being successful in everything we do
STR-1:

KEY-522709: We always have a strong focus on our long-term goals and this signing was definitely made with that in mind
STR-1:

KEY-522710: With every decision we make, we ask ourselves if it satisfies the long-term criteria we're working towards. He's going to be a big part of hour journey towards success
STR-1:

KEY-522711: We'll give him all the tools he needs to be successful, the rest is up to him as to how he defines his place at the club
STR-1:

KEY-522712: We want to help him write his own future at the club. He'll get all the support he needs and the rest will be up to him
STR-1:

KEY-522713: Once a player comes through the doors here for the first time, their future is in their hands. He has to really make the most of this opportunity
STR-1:

KEY-522714: We know what we'd like him to be, but the responsibility to make the most of this opportunity is all his now
STR-1:

KEY-522715: Do [%person#1-you] have the wage budget to bring in the players [%person#1-you] need or will [%person#1-you] be talking to [%job#2] [%person#2] to ask for a bigger budget?
STR-1:

KEY-522716: [%person#1-I] think it's clear we need to spend more; wages correlate more with success than transfer fees do, and that's a conversation we'll hopefully have soon
STR-1:

KEY-522717: [%person#1-I] feel we need to be more competitive in the salaries we offer and that might have to be something we talk about in due course
STR-1:

KEY-522718: [%person#1-I]'ve been given a budget and [%person#1-I]'m happy to work within it. Our players are paid well
STR-1:

KEY-522719: [%person#1-I] don't think simply throwing money at things is going to help. We have to set sensible limits and not begin to let players hold to us ransom either
STR-1:

KEY-522720: Can we have [%person#1-your] thoughts on the [%comp#1-short] draw?
STR-1:

KEY-522721: What do [%person#1-you] think about the [%comp#1-short] draw?
STR-1:

KEY-522722: [%person#1-I]'m pleased; we think we've got a good chance of progressing
STR-1:

KEY-522723: [%person#1-I] think we have to be happy with the way it's come out and we're confident in our ability to make progress through the competition
STR-1:

KEY-522724: [%person#1-I]'m excited! There are no easy matches but we know what we're capable of
STR-1:

KEY-522725: [%person#1-I] think the level of excitement just went up; we know what we're up against but we believe in our ability
STR-1:

KEY-522726: It's not an easy draw by any means, but that's why we're here; we want to be tested at the highest levels
STR-1:

KEY-522727: [%person#1-I]'m sure there are easier draws but we're certainly not going to shy away from a challenge
STR-1:

KEY-522728: It's one of the tougher draws we could've had but we'll give it our best
STR-1:

KEY-522729: We're going to be up against it but we're not prepared to back down
STR-1:

KEY-522730: Go on then, where are [%person#1-you] going to finish?
STR-1:

KEY-522731: Putting it on record, where do [%person#1-you] think [%person#1-you]'ll finish?
STR-1:

KEY-522732: [%person#1-I] always aim for the stars so we want to win the group
STR-1:

KEY-522733: We want to win every match, it's as simple as that
STR-1:

KEY-522734: [%person#1-I] think we'll do well; anything could happen, but we're in with a fine chance
STR-1:

KEY-522735: [%person#1-I]'m optimistic and think we'll give anyone a game
STR-1:

KEY-522736: [%person#1-I]'m not going to play any mind games, but we're up for a challenge, put it that way
STR-1:

KEY-522737: We haven't got it easy but we'll give it everything we've got
STR-1:

KEY-522738: We'll take it one game at a time, that's all we can do
STR-1:

KEY-522739: We're probably up against it a bit but all we can do it to take things one game at a time and work hard for our rewards
STR-1:

KEY-522740: Is it fair to say that [%team#2-short] are [%person#1-your] toughest opponents?
STR-1:

KEY-522741: [%team#2-short] would seem to be [%person#1-your] toughest opponent, right?
STR-1:

KEY-522742: Yeah, they're a great team, and we'll have our work cut out when we play them
STR-1:

KEY-522743: They're about as good as it gets; we're going to be in for a proper challenge there
STR-1:

KEY-522744: [%person#1-I] don't think anyone can deny that; they're one of the favourites to win the whole thing
STR-1:

KEY-522745: They're a genuine contender and [%person#1-I] don't think you'll find many people arguing with that assessment
STR-1:

KEY-522746: They're good, but so is everyone in the group. We can't afford to take anyone lightly
STR-1:

KEY-522747: Let's not be unfair to the other teams in the group; they're all very good as well
STR-1:

KEY-522748: [%person#1-I] think we're as good as anyone and we should be the team everyone else worries about
STR-1:

KEY-522749: [%person#1-I] think we're the best team in the group and everyone else should, and probably does, fear playing us
STR-1:

KEY-522750: With [%nation#1] represented by [%team_list#1] in the competition this season, what do [%person#1-you] think about the chances of {an}[%nation#1-nationality] winner?
STR-1:

KEY-522751: Will we see {an}[%nation#1-nationality] winner in the competition this season given [%team_list#1] are involved?
STR-1:

KEY-522752: [%person#1-I] think we're all contenders, there's a pretty good chance
STR-1:

KEY-522753: [%person#1-I] don't see why any one of those teams can't win it. Everyone has a real chance
STR-1:

KEY-522754: There's a chance; there's always a chance, but it's not going to come easy
STR-1:

KEY-522755: It's going to be hard, but why not? Those teams are all as good as anyone else
STR-1:

KEY-522756: [%person#1-I] think we have the best chance and everyone else will struggle to do as well
STR-1:

KEY-522757: If it's not us, then [%person#1-I] can't see how it'll be any of the others
STR-1:

KEY-522758: The depth of quality in the tournament is really good and [%person#1-I] think we're all up against it
STR-1:

KEY-522759: [%person#1-I]'d be very surprised if there was {an}[%nation#1-nationality] winner really
STR-1:

KEY-522760: What do [%person#1-you] make of [%team#2-short] being drawn against [%team_list#1]?
STR-1:

KEY-522761: What are [%person#1-you] thoughts on [%team#2-short] getting [%team_list#1] in the draw?
STR-1:

KEY-522762: [%person#1-I] think they'll do well, they have to be considered a real contender to win the whole thing
STR-1:

KEY-522763: It's an interesting draw but [%person#1-I] make them one of the best teams in the tournament
STR-1:

KEY-522764: [%person#1-I] think it's a very favourable draw and [%person#1-I]'m quite jealous!
STR-1:

KEY-522765: [%person#1-I]'d have been delighted with that draw! They've had a stroke of luck for sure
STR-1:

KEY-522766: [%person#1-I] think it's a really awkward group, harder than it looks, and they'll do well to come through it
STR-1:

KEY-522767: [%person#1-I]'m happy that's not our group; it looks a tricky one
STR-1:

KEY-522768: They're going to have their work cut out to get through from that draw, [%person#1-I] don't envy them
STR-1:

KEY-522769: For [%person#1-me] it's the sort of group that they could really struggle in, but [%person#1-I]'ve been wrong before
STR-1:

KEY-522770: Do [%person#1-you] want to say anything about the pressure [%person#2] is under at [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-522771: How sympathetic are [%person#1-you] towards another manager in [%person#2], who is coming under increasing pressure at [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-522772: [%person#2-He] doesn't deserve the criticism coming [%person#2-his] way and [%person#2-he]'ll prove [%person#2-his] detractors wrong
STR-1:

KEY-522773: Every manager deserves more patience and time and [%person#2-he] is no exception
STR-1:

KEY-522774: [%person#1-I] always stress patience and understanding. Getting rid of [%person#2-him] would solve nothing
STR-1:

KEY-522775: They'd be making a very rash decision if they were to part company with [%person#2-him]
STR-1:

KEY-522776: Everyone wants someone to blame in football now and [%person#2-he]'ll be the first to tell you that it's usually the manager who gets it
STR-1:

KEY-522777: [%person#2-He]'s the manager and he'll always be the first to get the blame. That's the unfortunate fact of life
STR-1:

KEY-522778: It's a results business and, if the results aren't there, [%person#2-he] knows what comes next
STR-1:

KEY-522779: We all know what's expected of managers these days and, if [%person#2-he]'s not producing the goods, [%person#2-he]'ll probably lose [%person#2-his] job
STR-1:

KEY-522780: What was [%person#1-your] reaction to [%person#2] being sacked by [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-522781: [%person#1-I] was very sorry to see [%person#2-him] go; we know managers don't get the time they deserve nowadays, and that was another harsh example of the business we're in
STR-1:

KEY-522782: Every manager knows they're only a few bad results away from potentially losing their job, so [%person#2-first] has [%person#1-my] sympathies
STR-1:

KEY-522783: [%person#1-I] think there was a sense, rightly or wrongly, that it was coming, but none of us really knows what was happening there
STR-1:

KEY-522784: It's not really [%person#1-my] place to comment but, if they think they're better off with a new manager, that's their choice to make
STR-1:

KEY-522785: Can we expect more of that attacking football from [%person#1-your] team considering how well the fans seemed to receive it?
STR-1:

KEY-522786: [%person#1-I] want to attack and score goals and we're going to keep trying to head in that direction
STR-1:

KEY-522787: That's the plan; we'll always need to strike a balance but, where we can, we'll have the inclination to attack
STR-1:

KEY-522788: [%person#1-I]'m sure we'll attack when appropriate but it might not become our go-to approach because it's not necessarily the best way to win
STR-1:

KEY-522789: We'll attack when we have to, but we'll always be aiming for a robust and strong defence, and [%person#1-I] think the fans will enjoy winning that way just as much
STR-1:

KEY-522790: [%person#1-You]'ve earned a lot of praise for [%person#1-your] attacking approach; is that something [%person#1-you] plan to continue with?
STR-1:

KEY-522791: [%person#1-I] like watching attacking football and [%person#1-I] think it's the only way to be consistently successful
STR-1:

KEY-522792: That's the plan! We'll always strive for balance but we want to attack and score goals
STR-1:

KEY-522793: [%person#1-I]'m sure there will be times where we have to take a more measured approach, that's how football works
STR-1:

KEY-522794: Who knows what tomorrow will bring? Football is an ever-changing game and what works now might not work next time around. We have to constantly adapt
STR-1:

KEY-522795: [%person#1-Your] passing style of play has garnered plenty of support; can we expect that to continue?
STR-1:

KEY-522796: [%person#1-You]'ve received a lot of praise for an attractive style of play recently. Is that how [%person#1-you] want to move forward?
STR-1:

KEY-522797: [%person#1-I] want to play the sort of football [%person#1-I] like to watch, so that's how we approach our craft
STR-1:

KEY-522798: We play this way because it suits the players and gives us the best chance of winning. We'll continue to work in this way
STR-1:

KEY-522799: There always has to be a balance but we want to set the tempo and play on our terms
STR-1:

KEY-522800: [%person#1-I] like possession, [%person#1-I] like the security it provides, and [%person#1-I] think it works for us
STR-1:

KEY-522801: We'll play this way when it works and, when a change of approach is needed, we'll change
STR-1:

KEY-522802: [%person#1-I]'m a pragmatist too; if [%person#1-I] need to play a certain way to win, then that's going to happen from time to time
STR-1:

KEY-522803: We're flexible enough to play in a number of different ways as and when required
STR-1:

KEY-522804: [%person#1-I] want us to be flexible rather than predictable. That's what we're working towards
STR-1:

KEY-522805: Many fans voiced their displeasure that [%male#2] wasn't substituted after his poor performance. Can [%person#1-you] explain the decision to leave him on?
STR-1:

KEY-522806: The fans were seemingly amazed that [%male#2] wasn't substituted today. What about did you see in his performance that perhaps they didn't?
STR-1:

KEY-522807: There were groans around the ground today at [%male#2]{s} display. Why did [%person#1-you] persist with him amidst calls for him to be replaced?
STR-1:

KEY-522808: [%person#1-I] actually thought he was one of our better players today
STR-1:

KEY-522809: The fans are entitled to their opinion but [%person#1-I] completely disagree and was happy with what he offered us
STR-1:

KEY-522810: [%person#1-I] won't pretend their pleas couldn't be heard but the selections are down to my judgment and [%person#1-I] was happy with his performance
STR-1:

KEY-522811: [%person#1-I] didn't see the need to substitute him. [%person#1-I]'ll always have faith in him to deliver
STR-1:

KEY-522812: [%person#1-I] saw heart, passion and desire every second he was on the field. Those attributes always make it tough to substitute the player
STR-1:

KEY-522813: There were elements of [%male#2]{s} game today that I'm sure frustrated them but [%person#1-I]'m always keen to keep a player of his quality on the pitch
STR-1:

KEY-522814: The options [%person#1-I] had from the bench were limited. In the end [%person#1-I] was stuck between a rock and a hard place about whether to change things up
STR-1:

KEY-522815: [%person#1-I] was hoping he'd play his way back into the match. [%person#1-I] agree he could've been better but criticism from the supporters seems like an overreaction
STR-1:

KEY-522816: [%male#2] is a confidence player. [%person#1-I] was disappointed by what [%person#1-I] heard from the supporters today
STR-1:

KEY-522817: The fans are welcome to voice their opinion but ultimately [%person#1-I] make the decisions
STR-1:

KEY-522818: [%person#1-I]'ve been in the game a long time. If [%person#1-I] was to explain everything the average fan doesn't see we'll be here for a long time
STR-1:

KEY-522819: What do you want [%person#1-me] to say? [%person#1-I]'ve never been a manager who caves to fan pressure and [%person#1-I]'m not planning on changing anytime soon
STR-1:

KEY-522820: How important has [%male#2] been this season? His [%number#1] assists have earned plenty of praise
STR-1:

KEY-522821: [%person#1-I] think he's been brilliant. When he plays to his full ability there aren't many better
STR-1:

KEY-522822: He's been very, very good, and is finding the sort of consistency required to separate him from the pack and mark him out as a top player
STR-1:

KEY-522823: [%person#1-I] think he's done well, but there can be no room for complacency; he needs to keep working hard and keep producing
STR-1:

KEY-522824: [%person#1-I] appreciate a good stat like anyone else, but his real value has come as part of the team, not as an individual
STR-1:

KEY-522825: How important do [%person#1-you] think it is that [%stadium#1] has become such a fortress of late?
STR-1:

KEY-522826: Stats show that home advantage exists and so we should be looking to benefit as much from that as possible. We're proud of our home record
STR-1:

KEY-522827: [%person#1-I] want [%stadium#1] to be a place teams fear coming to. We should be able to go out there for every match knowing we're already ahead in that regard
STR-1:

KEY-522828: [%person#1-I] believe in stressing the fundamentals of football and a good home record is one of those fundamentals
STR-1:

KEY-522829: [%person#1-I]'ll take wins wherever we manage to get them, [%person#1-I]'m not precious about a strong home record or anything like that
STR-1:

KEY-522830: Why have [%person#1-you] been so good away from home recently?
STR-1:

KEY-522831: [%person#1-I] have a squad that seems to revel in playing the role of spoiler. We really enjoy going into someone else's home ground and taking the points away with us, we have that mentality
STR-1:

KEY-522832: Our style suits playing away from home. The onus isn't necessarily on us to set the tempo and control the play, but instead we can enjoy ourselves
STR-1:

KEY-522833: Most teams are typically a bit more open and attacking at home and we're very well set up to exploit the opportunities that gives us in return
STR-1:

KEY-522834: Maybe it's to do with pressure; you never want to let your own fans down, but when it's someone else's home crowd, much of that disappears
STR-1:

KEY-522835: Why do [%person#1-you] think [%person#1-your] team has one of the best attacking records in the league?
STR-1:

KEY-522836: [%person#1-I] think it's a mixture of mentality and quality at the end of the day. We want to attack, we want to score goals, and we're very capable of both
STR-1:

KEY-522837: Everything ultimately comes back to working hard to improve. [%person#1-I]'m lucky to work with a group of players who really get it
STR-1:

KEY-522838: We spend a lot of time working out how best to attack our opponents and it's always at the forefront of our minds to go out and score goals
STR-1:

KEY-522839: [%person#1-I] actually think we could have been even better in front of goal; there's always room for improvement!
STR-1:

KEY-522840: How good has [%male#2] been recently? He's scoring a goal every [%number#1] minutes this season?
STR-1:

KEY-522841: How impressed have [%person#1-you] been with [%male#2], who is scoring at a rate of a goal every [%number#1] minutes?
STR-1:

KEY-522842: He can be as good as he wants to be; the challenge is to keep on making progress
STR-1:

KEY-522843: He's doing really well and wants to keep on getting better and better. We expect that from him
STR-1:

KEY-522844: [%person#1-I]'m very happy with him and hopefully he can continue to impress
STR-1:

KEY-522845: His contributions have been important and [%person#1-I] hope he keeps it up
STR-1:

KEY-522846: He's undeniably been productive but, in terms of whether he can improve, it might be more about his all-round game than his scoring record
STR-1:

KEY-522847: His goals will come and go but [%person#1-I]'m more concerned with where his all-round game goes next. We have to challenge him
STR-1:

KEY-522848: His numbers will probably regress to the mean eventually but that doesn't diminish his contributions
STR-1:

KEY-522849: [%person#1-I] think his scoring rate will eventually regress a bit but, as long as he's playing well, that's fine
STR-1:

KEY-522850: What do [%person#1-you] think the future holds for [%male#2] as he continues to impress on loan with [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-522851: As [%male#2] continues to do well for [%team#2-short], what do [%person#1-you] think his playing pathway looks like?
STR-1:

KEY-522852: He's doing really well and showing that sending him on loan was definitely the best thing for him. He's making great progress
STR-1:

KEY-522853: He's progressing really well and, if he can keep going, the sky's the limit really
STR-1:

KEY-522854: It's been really pleasing to see him play well and we all hope he continue to develop in the right way, both for his own good and for the benefit of this club
STR-1:

KEY-522855: He's showing a maturity and a confidence in himself, which is vital if he's to take the next steps to playing at even higher levels. He has to continue to work hard now
STR-1:

KEY-522856: It's fine to be encouraged by his form, he's doing well, but it's also important to be patient and understand the long-term process
STR-1:

KEY-522857: He's definitely one for the future; he's doing well now, and showing what a good footballer he is, but there's a long way to go for him just yet
STR-1:

KEY-522858: He's doing well but he'd be the first to tell you that the bar is very high here and he has a lot of work ahead of him if he's to return and stand a chance of playing for [%team#1-short]
STR-1:

KEY-522859: He's doing what we've asked of him; the next question is whether he can go above and beyond that, and by how much
STR-1:

KEY-522860: Has he outgrown [%team#2-short]? Does he need a fresh challenge?
STR-1:

KEY-522861: Is it time for him to move on from [%team#2-short] in search of a new challenge?
STR-1:

KEY-522862: Maybe, we'll have to see. [%person#1-I] just want to keep pushing him to be even better
STR-1:

KEY-522863: Everything's possible. We'll keep doing things to challenge him and move him forward as best we can
STR-1:

KEY-522864: [%person#1-I] think everything's going to come to a head eventually and we'll have a decision to make
STR-1:

KEY-522865: He might need a new challenge but we're hopeful that he can do that here
STR-1:

KEY-522866: [%person#1-I]'ve been trying to impress the importance of stability on him; there are always obstacles for him to overcome but we want him here through all of it
STR-1:

KEY-522867: If you ask [%person#1-me], he should stay here and value what he has, and know that we can move him forwards personally and professionally
STR-1:

KEY-522868: He's under contract and [%person#1-I] expect him to honour that
STR-1:

KEY-522869: As far as [%person#1-I]'m concerned, he's under contract, and we expect him to adhere to that deal
STR-1:

KEY-522870: Are [%person#1-you] worries by [%male#2]{s} struggles on loan at [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-522871: Do [%person#1-you] have any cause for concern about [%male#2]{s} poor form during his loan spell at [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-522872: [%person#1-I]'m not worried, that's why he's on loan. Part of developing as a player is overcoming these tough spells
STR-1:

KEY-522873: That's why he's out on loan. You have to take the ups with the downs in football and [%person#1-I] think he'll show himself very capable of handling it
STR-1:

KEY-522874: [%person#1-I]'m not unduly worried, it's just a dip in form, it happens to everyone
STR-1:

KEY-522875: [%person#1-I]'m not bothered, we know his quality, and that's the most important thing
STR-1:

KEY-522876: This is where he needs to show that he has the toughness to come through bad moments and find his quality again. That's why we've sent him on loan
STR-1:

KEY-522877: Every player experiences this multiple times throughout their careers and, for someone like [%male#2-first], it's a challenge for him to overcome
STR-1:

KEY-522878: He'll be the first to admit that he's not played as well recently, and he's working hard to improve
STR-1:

KEY-522879: He knows he's not played well enough, so the next step is to recapture his best form
STR-1:

KEY-522880: Are [%person#1-you] worried about [%male#2]{s} lack of playing time on loan at [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-522881: [%male#2] hasn't exactly been able to find regular playing time on loan at [%team#2-short]; is that a concern?
STR-1:

KEY-522882: We obviously want him to be playing regular football and, if that's not happening, we might need to step in
STR-1:

KEY-522883: He needs to play regularly. If [%team#2-short] can't find a way to involve him more often, [%person#1-I]'m sure other clubs will
STR-1:

KEY-522884: [%person#1-I] think it's obvious we want him to play as often as possible and it might be that the two clubs need to have a little chat about it
STR-1:

KEY-522885: [%person#1-I]'m not best pleased by how things are going, he needs to play more, and [%person#1-I]'ll be making [%person#1-my] concerns clear
STR-1:

KEY-522886: He has to work hard to earn a place in the team. That's life in football and that's part of the loan experience
STR-1:

KEY-522887: Nobody is guaranteed playing time anywhere and he knows it's up to him to force his way into the team more often
STR-1:

KEY-522888: It's up to him. Players have to earn the right to play
STR-1:

KEY-522889: Nothing will be handed to him; he's gone on loan there with the chance to play, but he has to earn every minute
STR-1:

KEY-522890: How happy were [%person#1-you] to see [%male#2] scoring on the international stage?
STR-1: Ông vui mừng như thế nào khi thấy [%male#2] ghi bàn trên đấu trường quốc tế?

KEY-522891: How delighted were [%person#1-you] to see [%male#2] on the scoresheet for his country?
STR-1:

KEY-522892: [%male#2] was amongst the goals for his country during the international break. How pleasing is it to see one of [%person#1-your] players scoring for their nation?
STR-1:

KEY-522893: [%person#1-I] was glued to the TV cheering him on as it went in. He's a great player and [%person#1-I]'m thrilled for him
STR-1:

KEY-522894: He's deserved the chance to represent his nation and it's fantastic to see him taking his opportunity by getting a goal
STR-1: Anh ấy xứng đáng có cơ hội đại diện cho quốc gia của mình và thật tuyệt vời khi thấy anh ấy tận dụng cơ hội của mình bằng cách ghi bàn

KEY-522895: [%male#2-first] is a pleasure to work with. To see him score is a wonderful feeling and no one deserves success more than him
STR-1:

KEY-522896: [%male#2-first] is an important member of this team and everybody is delighted to see him score for his country
STR-1:

KEY-522897: If anyone deserves this success it's [%male#2-first]. He works hard in training every day and his endeavour is paying off for his nation
STR-1:

KEY-522898: The team caught the replay of his goal during training and a large cheer went up. We couldn't be happier for him
STR-1:

KEY-522899: [%person#1-I]'m pleased for him. The challenge for [%male#2-first] now is maintaining that form at club level
STR-1:

KEY-522900: [%person#1-My] focus is on his performances for this football club, not his displays for his country
STR-1:

KEY-522901: [%person#1-I]'m sure it's a fantastic achievement for him and his family but it doesn't gain us any points
STR-1:

KEY-522902: One performance doesn't define a player. If he wants proper recognition then consistency is the key for him
STR-1:

KEY-522903: [%person#1-I]'m happy he scored but it doesn't change much for [%person#1-me]. [%person#1-My] main concern is ensuring that form continues into performances for this club
STR-1:

KEY-522904: Good for him but he wins no brownie points from [%person#1-me]. [%person#1-I]'ll start running down the touchline celebrating when he scores big goals in a [%team#1-short] shirt
STR-1:

KEY-522905: Is [%male#2] handling the weight of expectation right now?
STR-1:

KEY-522906: [%male#2] has come under increasing scrutiny and pressure recently; are [%person#1-you] confident he can handle that?
STR-1:

KEY-522907: [%person#1-I] don't think the [%male#2-first] [%person#1-I] know is going to have any problem with that. He has a tremendous ability to block out all the noise and focus on his game
STR-1:

KEY-522908: [%person#1-I] have every confidence that he'll be fine. If anything, he's going from strength to strength
STR-1:

KEY-522909: From what [%person#1-I]'ve seen recently, he's using the attention to take his game to even greater heights
STR-1:

KEY-522910: [%person#1-I] think all of this attention could actually help him; he has the ability to harness it and show what else he has to offer
STR-1:

KEY-522911: [%person#1-I]'ve told him to ignore the talk and [%person#1-I] hope he does
STR-1:

KEY-522912: Hopefully he stays away from all of that and stays focused. [%person#1-I]'ll do what [%person#1-I] can to make sure that happens
STR-1:

KEY-522913: You'd all absolutely love him to fail, wouldn't you?
STR-1:

KEY-522914: [%person#1-I] see what you're all doing; build him up just to cut him down. It's so predictable
STR-1:

KEY-522915: What are [%person#1-your] thoughts about the criticism directed towards [%team#1-short] for the number of players currently out on loan?
STR-1:

KEY-522916: What do [%person#1-you] make of the criticism [%team#1-short] have received for the number of players loaned out by the club?
STR-1:

KEY-522917: We're working within the rules, these players are just as much a part of the club as anyone else, and we consider them very important for our future
STR-1:

KEY-522918: There's absolutely nothing wrong with what we're doing. Everyone else has the potential to act in the same way, we have players we think very highly of, and we're helping them to develop their careers
STR-1:

KEY-522919: These players want to be here, they're taking the next steps in their careers, and they have a fantastic opportunity they want to make the most of
STR-1:

KEY-522920: It's a fantastic opportunity for these players to be a part of this club, we believe in them, and they believe in the process
STR-1:

KEY-522921: We use the loan market to help us decide who's going to stand the best chance of meeting the standard to make it here. That's something clubs have done forever
STR-1:

KEY-522922: These loan moves help us, and the players, to work out what level they're able to play at. Everyone else can do that if they want to
STR-1:

KEY-522923: This sport is more of a business these days and, if you're not trying to maximise your income streams, you're going to get left behind
STR-1:

KEY-522924: [%person#1-I] won't lie, there's a financial motivation to this, but it's something every club could and, in [%person#1-my] opinion should, be trying
STR-1:

KEY-522925: [%person#1-You]'re on a good run of form; how much of that is down to the air of positivity that seems to be around at the moment?
STR-1:

KEY-522926: Do [%person#1-you] think that player happiness and your positive recent results go hand in hand?
STR-1:

KEY-522927: There seems to be a real buzz around [%stadium#1] at the moment. How much of an effect do [%person#1-you] think that is having right now?
STR-1:

KEY-522928: There's definitely a buzz in the air at the moment and [%person#1-you] can see it in the players every day. [%person#1-I]'m going to do [%person#1-my] all to keep it like this
STR-1:

KEY-522929: [%person#1-You] know [%person#1-you]'re on to something special when everyone turns up to training smiling and willing to work hard. It's really paying off and the players deserve full praise for their efforts
STR-1:

KEY-522930: It's a very special place to be right now and [%person#1-I]'m honoured to be among it. This is exactly the type of spirit and form every team strives for
STR-1:

KEY-522931: It's good! There's an atmosphere around the place that's cautiously positive and it seems to be giving us the right balance on the pitch
STR-1:

KEY-522932: [%person#1-I] hope the fans are enjoying it as much as the players and staff seem to be, everything is going according to plan
STR-1:

KEY-522933: Let's all hope we can keep it up. [%person#1-I]'m convinced there's a direct correlation between player mood and performance so [%person#1-I]'m happy with where we're at
STR-1:

KEY-522934: We're doing well and [%person#1-I] need to do [%person#1-my] best to give us the best chance of continuing
STR-1:

KEY-522935: [%person#1-I]'m happy with the team spirit in this moment and [%person#1-I] hope it can continue
STR-1:

KEY-522936: Whatever happens with this team we're always here for each other. With that kind of camaraderie [%person#1-I] reckon we can keep it up
STR-1:

KEY-522937: We absolutely cannot take anything for granted right now. It's at times like this we need to focus more than ever
STR-1:

KEY-522938: Form and morale are never permanent and will fluctuate so we need to keep that in mind, otherwise we'll be the engineers of our own downfall
STR-1:

KEY-522939: We're in a good place but we shouldn't let it go to our heads, we need to keep this up for as long as possible
STR-1:

KEY-522940: What impact on [%person#1-your] squad do [%person#1-you] think [%male#2]{s} exit will have?
STR-1:

KEY-522941: With [%male#2-surname] having left the club, how does that change things?
STR-1:

KEY-522942: Now that it's out of the way we can fully focus on the task at hand and push on from here
STR-1:

KEY-522943: [%person#1-I]'m hoping that focus levels will pick up a bit now that the distraction is over and hope to see the best that everyone has to offer
STR-1:

KEY-522944: [%person#1-I]'m looking to bring everyone together and really form a dedicated collective of trusted players who will give their all for this team
STR-1:

KEY-522945: Getting a squad to really gel together can be tricky so [%person#1-I]'ll be looking to form a tight bond between everyone at the club
STR-1:

KEY-522946: [%male#2-surname] was always a professional during his time with us and [%person#1-I] wish him the best of luck for his future
STR-1:

KEY-522947: [%male#2] has gone now and [%person#1-I] would like to look to the future
STR-1:

KEY-522948: [%male#2] had some excellent qualities but unfortunately nothing is permanent and the move was the right decision for both parties
STR-1:

KEY-522949: [%person#1-I] think [%male#2-first] was a fantastic player and [%person#1-I]'ll be sure to keep an eye on the rest of his career
STR-1:

KEY-522950: What would [%person#1-you] say [%person#1-your] style is as relates to people management?
STR-1:

KEY-522951: [%person#1-My] door is open. We need each other to be successful and that really relies on strong human relationships above anything else
STR-1:

KEY-522952: This can be an unforgiving industry at times and [%person#1-I] have to look after [%person#1-my] players. It might sound trite but that really doesn't matter
STR-1:

KEY-522953: [%person#1-I]'m not someone who likes to be involved in everything every second of the day. [%person#1-I]'m there if anyone needs [%person#1-me]
STR-1:

KEY-522954: [%person#1-I]'m not going to watch over everything they do. They're all grown-ups, they can handle their own business
STR-1:

KEY-522955: To say opportunities in management for women have been scant would be an understatement. How proud are [%person#1-you] right now?
STR-1:

KEY-522956: [%person#1-surname] proud to lead charge
STR-1:

KEY-522957: [%person#1-surname] aiming to open door to others
STR-1:

KEY-522958: [%person#1-surname] frustrated that opportunity took so long
STR-1:

KEY-522959: [%person#1-surname] slams inequality
STR-1:

KEY-522960: [%person#1-I] don't want to be a lightning rod for controversy; [%person#1-I]'m here to do a job
STR-1:

KEY-522961: [%person#1-I]'m very proud and [%person#1-I] want to lead the charge for the next generation to show this is normal, that this is right
STR-1:

KEY-522962: [%person#1-I] want moments like this to prove to the world that we're all capable of doing this job. [%person#1-I] want to open doors
STR-1:

KEY-522963: [%person#1-I] think it's about time and [%person#1-I]'m honestly frustrated that this opportunity didn't come earlier
STR-1:

KEY-522964: [%person#1-I] can't believe that we're still talking about inequality in this era. It's time for change
STR-1:

KEY-522965: Do [%person#1-you] think that sexism exists in football?
STR-1:

KEY-522966: [%person#1-surname] discusses sexism in football
STR-1:

KEY-522967: [%person#1-surname] on women in football
STR-1:

KEY-522968: [%person#1-surname]: Change has been too slow in coming
STR-1:

KEY-522969: [%person#1-surname] hits out at discrimination in football
STR-1:

KEY-522970: If you're asking a woman if there's sexism in football, you're asking the wrong person
STR-1:

KEY-522971: [%person#1-I] don't know if there's overt sexism per se, maybe people have just grown comfortable with the status quo
STR-1:

KEY-522972: It's no secret that women in football are still in the extreme minority. Whether that's through sexism, fear, self-preservation or anything else isn't really for [%person#1-me] to say
STR-1:

KEY-522973: [%person#1-I] think it does exist to an extent; change has been too slow in coming and you have to ask why that is
STR-1:

KEY-522974: Of course football is sexist, the very fact you have to ask the question tells you that. It is fundamentally unfair and we have to do better
STR-1:

KEY-522975: How do [%person#1-you] think [%person#1-your] appointment will affect [%team#1-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-522976: [%person#1-surname]: [%team#1-short] are perfect for [%person#1-me]
STR-1:

KEY-522977: [%person#1-surname] has full support from [%team#1-short]
STR-1:

KEY-522978: [%person#1-surname] doesn't want to be a distraction
STR-1:

KEY-522979: [%person#1-surname] feels need to prove [%person#1-himself]
STR-1:

KEY-522980: That's for everyone else to decide, it doesn't bother [%person#1-me]
STR-1:

KEY-522981: This place is perfect for [%person#1-me]. It's a great opportunity at the right time and [%person#1-I] know we'll be successful together
STR-1:

KEY-522982: [%person#1-I] have the full support and backing of everyone here and [%person#1-I] would expect nothing less to be brutally honest
STR-1:

KEY-522983: [%person#1-I] don't want to be a distraction. [%person#1-I] know it comes with the territory but [%person#1-I] have work to do
STR-1:

KEY-522984: We all know what the stakes are and that [%person#1-I]'ll probably have to prove [%person#1-myself] more than others, but [%person#1-I]'ll embrace all the challenges that come [%person#1-my] way
STR-1:

KEY-522985: Are [%person#1-you] going to be focusing primarily on the [%comp#1-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-522986: Will [%person#1-your] priority be doing well in the [%comp#1-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-522987: For sure, the [%comp#1-short] is the club's biggest priority
STR-1:

KEY-522988: [%person#1-I] think we have to; that's the one we all really want to do well in
STR-1:

KEY-522989: The league is the heart and soul of every club and that's got to be our main focus
STR-1:

KEY-522990: We want to do well in the league, of course, that's a given
STR-1:

KEY-522991: We want to win every game, whatever competition we're playing in
STR-1:

KEY-522992: For a club like ours, we want to do as well as we can in every competition we play
STR-1:

KEY-522993: We've got a lot of football to play and it'd be wrong to focus on just one competition
STR-1:

KEY-522994: We'll show every competition the right amount of respect
STR-1:

KEY-522995: What does it mean to [%person#1-you] be the [%team#1-short] manager?
STR-1:

KEY-522996: [%person#1-I] am so, so happy, this is a club [%person#1-I]'ve supported for such a long time and it means everything to be given this opportunity
STR-1:

KEY-522997: [%person#1-I]'m truly delighted. This is [%person#1-my] club and [%person#1-I]'ll give this job absolutely everything [%person#1-I] have

STR-1:

KEY-523000: [%person#1-Your] arrival comes at a time when there is considerable doubt about [%male#2]{s} future at the club. Is he someone [%person#1-you]'d like to keep hold of?

STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-523023: Playing and managing are two very different things but [%person#1-I] know what it takes to get the job done at this level and [%person#1-I] can't wait to start

STR-1:

KEY-523027: Many of the best players didn't enjoy successful managerial careers, and some of the managerial greats didn't play to a high level. [%person#1-I]'m not expecting [%person#1-my] playing days to help very much
STR-1:

KEY-523028: [%person#1-I]'m taking nothing for granted; [%person#1-I] have to approach this opportunity with humility and to understand that [%person#1-I] have a lot to learn
STR-1:

KEY-523047: This club wants to grow and so do [%person#1-I]. We fit each other perfectly
STR-1:

KEY-523048: [%person#1-I] don't think anything truly leapt out, but this is a place where everything just seems right, you know?
STR-1:

KEY-523049: It's all the little things, and [%person#1-I] don't think [%person#1-I]'ll truly appreciate why this is the right fit for a while yet either
STR-1:

KEY-523050: What made [%person#1-you] sure this was the right job?
STR-1:

KEY-523051: Was there anything that gave [%person#1-you] reason to think this job might not have been the right one for [%person#1-you]?

KEY-523052: There really were no doubts; from the moment the opportunity came [%person#1-my] way [%person#1-I] knew [%person#1-I] wanted to be here
STR-1:

KEY-523053: [%person#1-I] have no reservations whatsoever. This is where [%person#1-I]'m meant to be
STR-1:

KEY-523054: When [%person#1-I] was offered the chance to work here [%person#1-I] jumped at it. [%person#1-I]'m incredibly humbled to be trusted with this job

STR-1:

KEY-523058: [%person#1-I]'m not going to come out here and say [%person#1-I] think this is an easy job, but it's one [%person#1-I] want to take on, and one [%person#1-I] intend to be successful in

STR-1:

KEY-523066: Look, every manager in every job wants to leave their mark, and [%person#1-I]'m no different. [%person#1-I]'m sure that [%person#1-I]'ll be getting into the market in due course
STR-1:

KEY-523067: [%person#1-I] think everyone knows that [%person#1-I]'ll eventually get into the transfer market and look to bring in quality where [%person#1-I] can

STR-1:

KEY-523092: [%person#1-I] only know one way to work and that's to be the best. If we're not trying to be the best, we're wasting our time
STR-1:

KEY-523093: As far as [%person#1-I]'m concerned, we should want to be the best team in the world. That level of ambition should drive everything we do

STR-1:

KEY-523115: We have to put the work in. That doesn't mean we're going to run until our legs fall off, but we will have to show that sort of commitment

STR-1:

KEY-523124: [%person#1-I] expect a lot from him and [%person#1-I] have no doubts he'll deliver. What a player he is
STR-1:

KEY-523125: He has the world at his feet and he knows [%person#1-I]'m expecting him to the lead the charge for us in future
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-523129: [%person#1-I] don't want to disappoint anyone in [%person#1-my] squad by ignoring them so [%person#1-I] try not to focus on individuals as a rule

KEY-523137: Yeah, we'll set that up pretty soon
STR-1:

KEY-523138: [%person#1-I] will be, yes

STR-1:

KEY-523141: [%person#1-I]'m not sure, it depends on the schedule, but it's unlikely
STR-1:

KEY-523142: [%person#1-I] don't think we're going to have time unfortunately
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-523148: [%person#1-surname] plans to introduce new signings

STR-1:

KEY-523157: [%person#1-I] don't think the fee has anything to do with it. He'll be a success and the narrative beyond that is out of [%person#1-my] hands
STR-1:

KEY-523158: What the media say and what we think about him inside the club are two different things. He knows who to listen to
STR-1:

KEY-523159: [%person#1-I] pay no attention to the money, [%person#1-I]'m not a banker. [%person#1-I] have a squad of players and they're all treated equally
STR-1:

KEY-523160: [%person#1-I]'m paid to manage these players and that's what [%person#1-I]'m focusing on. The fee means nothing to [%person#1-me] and [%person#1-I] don't think he cares either
STR-1:

KEY-523161: Is there a worry that [%male#2-surname] could become an expensive flop given the fee spent on him?
STR-1:

KEY-523162: In paying so much for [%male#2-surname], are [%person#1-you] worried he could become the latest in a long line of big-money flops across the football landscape?
STR-1:

KEY-523163: [%person#1-I] can see why people might be concerned, but we're happy to take the risk, because the rewards are so much greater
STR-1:

KEY-523164: Every deal comes with some sort of risk, and the more money you spend, the greater the risk. We'll have to wait and see
STR-1:

KEY-523165: It'll be a narrative that people are desperate to force, especially if he starts slowly, but [%person#1-I]'m not too worried
STR-1:

KEY-523166: It's almost as if people want these players to fail. If he ends up being labelled a flop, it certainly won't be our doing
STR-1:

KEY-523167: [%person#1-I] think he'll be a great success, simple
STR-1:

KEY-523168: [%person#1-I]'m not worried, he's a good player and we have a plan for him. That structure means we'll see the best of him
STR-1:

KEY-523169: He's going to be worth every single penny
STR-1:

KEY-523170: When all is said and done, he'll go down as one of our best-ever signings
STR-1:

KEY-523171: Is [%male#2-surname] one for the future at the age of [%number#2]?
STR-1:

KEY-523172: In signing {an}[%number#2] year-old, is [%male#2-surname] a player for the future more than the present day?
STR-1:

KEY-523173: His best work is definitely ahead of him, that's for sure
STR-1:

KEY-523174: He's going to enjoy a very bright and successful career and he is the future of this club now
STR-1:

KEY-523175: [%person#1-I] think it's fair and realistic to look at the long-term benefits of this deal as we build for the future
STR-1:

KEY-523176: [%person#1-I] think he can contribute quite early on but, yes, he'll really come into his own a couple of years from now
STR-1:

KEY-523177: [%person#1-I] don't see why he can't contribute right now, he's certainly good enough
STR-1:

KEY-523178: He's probably going to be even better in the future but that doesn't mean he can't come in and help us right away
STR-1:

KEY-523179: You can't wait around in football these days. [%person#1-I] want him to make an immediate impact and that's what he wants to do as well
STR-1:

KEY-523180: It's the nature of football now that you want an instant return on your investment and [%person#1-I] think he's got it in him to produce right away
STR-1:

KEY-523181: How do [%person#1-you] anticipate the squad reaction to the signing of [%male#2-surname]?
STR-1:

KEY-523182: Do you feel the squad will react positively to [%male#2-surname]{s} arrival?
STR-1:

KEY-523183: How do you expect the squad to respond to the signing of [%male#2-surname]?
STR-1:

KEY-523184: [%person#1-I] am convinced this signing will provide a boost to everyone at the club
STR-1:

KEY-523185: [%person#1-Myself] and the squad are delighted by [%male#2-first]{s} arrival
STR-1:

KEY-523186: [%person#1-I] expect everyone at the club is as excited as [%person#1-I] am. The squad should be delighted to welcome a player of [%male#2-surname]{s} quality
STR-1:

KEY-523187: Acquiring a top player can only have a positive impact on the squad
STR-1:

KEY-523188: [%male#2-First] gives us further depth and competition for places can only be a good thing
STR-1:

KEY-523189: [%person#1-I]'m hoping a fresh face can provide a boost to everyone
STR-1:

KEY-523190: [%person#1-I] can understand some players may worry for their place but we need depth to be competitive
STR-1:

KEY-523191: [%person#1-I]'ll address any issues internally but [%person#1-I] hope the squad are as excited as [%person#1-I] am
STR-1:

KEY-523192: A signing of this quality is always likely to turn heads. [%person#1-I]'m confident the squad on the whole will be pleased by [%male#2-surname]{s} arrival
STR-1:

KEY-523193: [%person#1-I] anticipate some unrest over the signing but my job first and foremost is assembling the best team possible
STR-1:

KEY-523194: If anyone thinks they are untouchable, they are wrong. We need competition for places to achieve our aims
STR-1:

KEY-523195: My job is to get results. [%person#1-I]'m not employed to keep the squad happy
STR-1:

KEY-523196: How does this signing affect [%person#1-your] transfer budget?
STR-1:

KEY-523197: Has this transfer impacted [%person#1-your] transfer budget much?
STR-1:

KEY-523198: Yeah, we used pretty much everything we have left, so [%person#1-I] wouldn't expect much more from us now
STR-1:

KEY-523199: We needed to use almost everything to pull off a deal like this so [%person#1-I] think any future business will be minimal
STR-1:

KEY-523200: We put a sizeable dent in our available funds, yeah
STR-1:

KEY-523201: [%person#1-I] think it's clear we spent big on this one
STR-1:

KEY-523202: [%person#1-I] still have enough money to make a few more deals if [%person#1-I] want to
STR-1:

KEY-523203: Of course we don't have as big a budget left now, but we can still spend if we want to
STR-1:

KEY-523204: [%person#1-I]'ve got plenty of scope to keep spending if the right deals come along
STR-1:

KEY-523205: This won't affect our ability to get more deals done
STR-1:

KEY-523206: How important will [%male#2] be in helping [%team#1-short] to be successful in the future?
STR-1:

KEY-523207: He's a fantastic player and we've brought him here to help us be successful
STR-1:

KEY-523208: [%person#1-I] believe he can make a massive contribution to this club now and in the future
STR-1:

KEY-523209: He's joining a very talented squad and it's as a collective that we will move forward. Win or lose, we're together
STR-1:

KEY-523210: [%person#1-I] don't want to put undue pressure on anyone, let alone a new signing. This is a team game
STR-1:

KEY-523211: Will [%male#2-surname] be able to give [%team#1-short] a decisive edge in big matches?
STR-1:

KEY-523212: That's why [%person#1-I] signed him. He lives for the big occasion and will be a huge addition to the squad in that regard
STR-1:

KEY-523213: [%person#1-I] think he's going to make us better in each and every match but, yes, we're hopeful that he makes the difference when the stakes are at their highest
STR-1:

KEY-523214: [%person#1-I] don't think we need to be putting that sort of pressure on players from day one; we win as a team and we lose as a team, not as individuals
STR-1:

KEY-523215: [%person#1-I] wouldn't say that was a particular focus of [%person#1-mine] when signing him. He's a quality player, let's leave it at that
STR-1:

KEY-523216: Could [%male#2-surname] prove a difference-maker for your team?
STR-1:

KEY-523217: One player can sometimes prove the difference between winning and losing in important matches. Do [%person#1-you] see [%male#2-surname] as a player in that mould?
STR-1:

KEY-523218: At times a moment of brilliance can win a game. How pivotal do you expect [%male#2-surname] to be in those types of matches for [%team#1-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-523219: [%person#1-I]'m delighted to have him here. He's the type of player who gets fans out their seats
STR-1:

KEY-523220: He's a top player and top players often decide big games. We've got huge hopes for him
STR-1:

KEY-523221: He's got a bag of tricks to work with. [%person#1-I] think he's the type of player that could prove crucial in important moments
STR-1:

KEY-523222: That's the aim! We certainly hope he'll make contributions when it matters most
STR-1:

KEY-523223: [%person#1-I]'m certainly confident he'll deliver in the big fixtures. That's the type of player he is
STR-1:

KEY-523224: We have no doubt of the quality he possesses and [%person#1-I] hope he showcases that at every opportunity
STR-1:

KEY-523225: [%person#1-I]'m not going to burden him by agreeing to statements like that. All [%person#1-I]'ll say is we're delighted he's here
STR-1:

KEY-523226: He wouldn't be here if we didn't believe in his quality but [%person#1-I]'m keen not to put labels on him
STR-1:

KEY-523227: [%person#1-I]'m not a fan of putting too much pressure on a new signing to deliver instantly. Let's allow him time to settle before expecting big performances
STR-1:

KEY-523228: [%person#1-I]'m not sure he fits that profile of player. We have others who already match that description
STR-1:

KEY-523229: [%person#1-I]'ll be looking at the players who have been at the club rather than a new signing
STR-1:

KEY-523230: That's not exactly his game. [%person#1-I]'d rather see him bringing consistency to the table first before any kind of extravagance
STR-1:

KEY-523231: Are we to expect more transfer window activity from [%person#1-you] before the deadline?
STR-1:

KEY-523232: Will [%team#1-short] continue to be active in the market before the transfer deadline?
STR-1:

KEY-523233: Yeah, we'll still be working to improve the squad, that's a safe assumption
STR-1:

KEY-523234: We're exploring what's out there and we'll definitely try to do some business where we can
STR-1:

KEY-523235: [%person#1-I]'d like to think this won't be the only deal we strike; we could do with a couple of new faces
STR-1:

KEY-523236: If we can bring some fresh faces in to give us some more options, that'd make [%person#1-me] happy
STR-1:

KEY-523237: We might need to sell first in order to balance the books, but anything's possible
STR-1:

KEY-523238: [%person#1-I]'m not sure; there might be outgoing business to take care of as well
STR-1:

KEY-523239: [%person#1-I] think we're probably done in all honesty
STR-1:

KEY-523240: [%person#1-I] wouldn't hold your breath for much more from us
STR-1:

KEY-523241: Are [%person#1-you] worried that [%male#2-first] doesn't speak [%language#1]?
STR-1:

KEY-523242: Is it a problem that [%male#2-first] doesn't speak [%language#1]?
STR-1:

KEY-523243: It might be a concern early on but we'll deal with it
STR-1:

KEY-523244: It makes one or two things harder at the start but hopefully it's not a big problem
STR-1:

KEY-523245: Learning the language will be one of the things he has to do in order to settle in
STR-1:

KEY-523246: Yeah, he'll need to start learning the language, that's something we'll work on
STR-1:

KEY-523247: [%person#1-I]'m not particularly worried, it's something that will come along naturally
STR-1:

KEY-523248: It just takes time for people to learn new skills, [%person#1-I] don't have any concerns
STR-1:

KEY-523249: We have no worries, football is a universal language
STR-1:

KEY-523250: He can play football and that speaks loudest. We're not worried
STR-1:

KEY-523251: Can we expect [%person#1-you] to continue to splash big cash on future transfer deals?
STR-1:

KEY-523252: Do [%person#1-you] intend to continue spending big chunks of [%person#1-your] transfer budget on deals like this?
STR-1:

KEY-523253: If it gets us the right players, [%person#1-I]'ll spend the money
STR-1:

KEY-523254: [%person#1-I]'ll spend whatever it takes to make us the team we want to be
STR-1:

KEY-523255: You have to spend money to get the best players and [%person#1-I]'ll continue doing that
STR-1:

KEY-523256: [%person#1-I] think it's clear the best players cost big money and, if we want them, we need to pay up
STR-1:

KEY-523257: [%person#1-I]'m looking to strike a balance between big-money deals and more value-for-money business that will have just as profound an effect
STR-1:

KEY-523258: We'll try to balance out our spending and find a bargain or two at the other end of the market
STR-1:

KEY-523259: This isn't how [%person#1-I] like to operate, so consider it an exception to the rule
STR-1:

KEY-523260: [%person#1-I]'m generally averse to this type of deal so [%person#1-I] wouldn't expect it to be a regular occurrence
STR-1:

KEY-523261: How good does it feel to welcome these new signings to the club?
STR-1:

KEY-523262: How proud are [%person#1-you] to welcome these new players to the club?
STR-1:

KEY-523263: [%person#1-I]'m very proud of the work the club has done to get these deals done, [%person#1-I]'m thrilled
STR-1:

KEY-523264: [%person#1-I] really am thrilled, these players are going to take us forward as a club, and we can't wait to get started
STR-1:

KEY-523265: It's always good to bring new players to the club and, when we can welcome players of this calibre, it feels really good
STR-1:

KEY-523266: [%person#1-I]'m very pleased, we're bringing real quality into the squad, and that can only be a good thing
STR-1:

KEY-523267: This is the first day of the future of this club; we'll have to be patient, but we can be excited too
STR-1:

KEY-523268: It's very nice to be able to welcome new players to the club, but let's give them time to settle in, and then get excited later
STR-1:

KEY-523269: [%person#1-I]'ll be glad to get back to the football and go from there. We've got work to do
STR-1:

KEY-523270: It'll be good to get out on to the pitch and work with them! We need to be patient but this is a good day
STR-1:

KEY-523271: What do [%person#1-you] think was the driving force behind [%male#2] wanting to come to [%team#1-short] and work with [%person#1-you]?
STR-1:

KEY-523272: We've forged a good relationship and [%person#1-I] think he recognises how much it will do for his career to come here
STR-1:

KEY-523273: [%person#1-I]'ve admired him from afar for a long time and this is just as much of an opportunity for [%person#1-me] as it is for him
STR-1:

KEY-523274: We're getting to know each other day by day but we share the same desire to take this club to new heights
STR-1:

KEY-523275: [%person#1-I] don't know what stories are out there; we don't have a relationship to speak of yet, but [%person#1-I]'m certain it won't take long for us to bond as team-mates
STR-1:

KEY-523276: What is [%male#2-surname]{s} best position, in [%person#1-your] opinion?
STR-1:

KEY-523277: What position do [%person#1-you] feel gets the most out of [%male#2-surname]?
STR-1:

KEY-523278: Is that where [%person#1-you] intend to play him then?
STR-1:

KEY-523279: That's where he'll play for [%person#1-your] team then?
STR-1:

KEY-523280: That's the plan. It's his preferred position and it's where we see him fitting in best
STR-1:

KEY-523281: Yeah, he fits a specific need and he does his best work there as well
STR-1:

KEY-523282: That's where we plan to use him but, such is football, there'll be times where we might have to move him around a little bit
STR-1:

KEY-523283: That's what [%person#1-I] want to do, but we're flexible, so there might be times where he plays in another position or role
STR-1:

KEY-523284: We'll have to wait and see. He's the sort of player who can do a lot so, depending on the need, we might use him elsewhere from time to time
STR-1:

KEY-523285: [%person#1-I] like to be flexible so there's definitely the potential for a bit of shuffling around and seeing how he contributes in different areas
STR-1:

KEY-523286: We value his versatility a lot, so take from that what you will
STR-1:

KEY-523287: [%person#1-I] think it'd be a shame to bring in such a talented versatile player and not take advantage of his ability to play in multiple positions and roles
STR-1:

KEY-523288: What sort of value does [%male#2] bring to the squad as he joins his [%number#1-nth_text] club?
STR-1:

KEY-523289: Is there a risk that, in making [%team#1-short] [%male#2]{s} [%number#1-nth_text] club, [%person#1-you]'re taking on a player on the downside of his career?
STR-1:

KEY-523290: [%person#1-I] think he's got plenty to offer on and off the pitch and [%person#1-I]'m happy he's here and [%person#1-I] think he'll be a huge success
STR-1:

KEY-523291: [%person#1-I]'m confident he'll be a huge success. He brings something to the squad that we'd otherwise lacked
STR-1:

KEY-523292: [%person#1-I] think he can settle here and feel at home. Whatever's happened in the past is done with, we're looking towards the future
STR-1:

KEY-523293: This is his home now and a place he can settle into and be comfortable. [%person#1-I] wouldn't have signed him if [%person#1-I] had concerns
STR-1:

KEY-523294: Just like everything else in football, we'll have to wait and see, but [%person#1-I]'m hopeful
STR-1:

KEY-523295: [%person#1-I] choose to be optimistic but, yes, we'll have to wait and see how it goes
STR-1:

KEY-523296: [%person#1-I]'m sure his ability to move around isn't going to come into question!
STR-1:

KEY-523297: If [%person#1-I] was funnier [%person#1-I]'d make a joke about how he's shown great movement in his career to date!
STR-1:

KEY-523298: Can this move help [%male#2] to finally realise the potential people have always talked about when it comes to his career?
STR-1:

KEY-523299: Are [%person#1-you] hopeful of being able to help [%male#2] finally realise his potential?
STR-1:

KEY-523300: He's got all the potential in the world to be a real star and [%person#1-I] want him to show that here
STR-1:

KEY-523301: He can be anything he wants to be. [%person#1-I] think there's a star in there and [%person#1-I] want to help bring that out of him
STR-1:

KEY-523302: in [%person#1-my] experience it takes being in the right environment for potential to flourish, and [%person#1-I] hope we can give that to him here
STR-1:

KEY-523303: [%person#1-I] really think this could be the move that finally helps it all come together for him
STR-1:

KEY-523304: Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard, and [%person#1-I]'ll be stressing the importance of that if he wants to reach the heights he's capable of reaching
STR-1:

KEY-523305: It all comes down to hard work. If he's prepared to put in the effort, [%person#1-I]'ll give him every opportunity to be the best player he can be
STR-1:

KEY-523306: [%person#1-I]'ll give him everything he needs to be successful. The rest is up to him
STR-1:

KEY-523307: It's up to him as to how good he can be. We'll help him as much as we can but it will eventually be about how much he wants it
STR-1:

KEY-523308: Does the role [%male#2] favours most fit into [%person#1-your] current tactical approach?
STR-1:

KEY-523309: Will [%person#1-you] be able to fit [%male#2]{s} role into [%person#1-your] tactics?
STR-1:

KEY-523310: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] fits us like a glove
STR-1:

KEY-523311: [%person#1-surname] confident [%male#2-surname] will fit in
STR-1:

KEY-523312: [%person#1-surname]: We'll work to accommodate [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-523313: [%person#1-surname] challenges [%male#2-surname] to adapt
STR-1:

KEY-523314: There are lots of ways for a new signing to adapt, we'll deal with each of them as necessary
STR-1:

KEY-523315: He fits us like a glove and we wanted to bring in a player of his exact profile. He's perfect
STR-1:

KEY-523316: We wanted to bring in a player who does what he does. He fits us like a glove and [%person#1-I] know how [%person#1-I] want to use him
STR-1:

KEY-523317: He's a player of real quality and [%person#1-I]'m confident he'll fit into our plans
STR-1:

KEY-523318: Good footballers are always able to adapt but [%person#1-I]'m confident he'll be great fit for our plans
STR-1:

KEY-523319: We'll work to accommodate him. If that means tweaking one or two things in order to get the best out of him, so be it
STR-1:

KEY-523320: You don't sign a player like [%male#2-first] without considering changes to accommodate him. We'll certainly be looking at all of our options
STR-1:

KEY-523321: It's not easy for new signings and there will be challenges to overcome. He'll have to meet those head-on
STR-1:

KEY-523322: We have plans for him, yes, but he also has to display the right attitude and right qualities to adapt as well
STR-1:

KEY-523323: Will [%person#1-you] be changing formation to ensure [%male#2] gets to play in his best role?
STR-1:

KEY-523324: Are [%person#1-you] prepared to change [%person#1-your] formation to make sure [%male#2] gets to play in his preferred role?
STR-1:

KEY-523325: [%person#1-surname] will do 'whatever it takes' for [%male#2-surname] to succeed
STR-1:

KEY-523326: [%person#1-surname]: We'll make a success of [%male#2-surname] here
STR-1:

KEY-523327: [%person#1-surname] wants [%male#2-surname] to adapt to [%team#1-short]
STR-1:

KEY-523328: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] has to work to fit our plans
STR-1:

KEY-523329: Who knows what the future will bring? I'm not saying anything definitive right now
STR-1:

KEY-523330: We'll do whatever it takes to make sure he's a roaring success here
STR-1:

STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-523397: Conflict creates change and [%person#1-I] like a bit of that in [%person#1-my] dressing room. It keeps things interesting
STR-1:

KEY-523410: We're lucky to have some strong leaders here already but [%person#1-I]'m sure he'll work with them to take us to the next level
STR-1:

KEY-523411: [%person#1-I] don't think he'll come in and throw his weight around, that's not in his nature
STR-1:

KEY-523412: He's a natural leader, so there'll be some impact, but he won't expect to start bossing everyone around if that's what you mean
STR-1:

KEY-523413: Will [%male#2] find it easy to join in with the squad's social groups? Are [%person#1-you] aware of different factions and the like?

STR-1:

KEY-523419: That's a question for the players; [%person#1-I] don't get involved with that side of things
STR-1:

KEY-523420: We've got a good bunch of lads who [%person#1-I]'m sure will welcome him with open arms
STR-1:

KEY-523421: He'll find his place here, we've got a good squad who have a range of interests and relationships
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-523424: He'll have to make friends! We've all been there in a new job, that's part of the process when you're in that situation
STR-1:

KEY-523425: Of course we'll help him but he has to cultivate those relationships and make new friends himself as well
STR-1:

KEY-523426: At the end of the day it's down to him. We'll be as welcoming as we always are, and the rest is what he makes of it
STR-1:

KEY-523427: [%person#1-I] think it's down to the player to work out where he fits in. We'll be ready to welcome him however he chooses to mix

STR-1:

KEY-523434: [%person#1-I]'ll be honest, [%person#1-I] didn't expect that to be asked, and don't really know what to say
STR-1:

KEY-523435: [%person#1-I] believe everyone can learn from each other and we'll be a richer squad for that
STR-1:

KEY-523436: In this sort of situation [%person#1-I] think everyone can learn new things from one another, and that's great
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-523438: He might well bring a fresh perspective that will make us rethink some things. That's important to [%person#1-me]
STR-1:

KEY-523439: [%person#1-I]'m not sure how the age difference will affect things to be honest. It could be a problem, it could be nothing
STR-1:

KEY-523440: Honestly, [%person#1-I] don't know if the age difference will be a problem, but we'll deal with anything that comes our way
STR-1:

KEY-523441: There might be one or two issues and, if that happens, it's [%person#1-my] job to sort them out
STR-1:

KEY-523442: [%person#1-I]'m the one who has to make sure everyone gets along so that's something for [%person#1-me] to worry about, not the players

STR-1:

KEY-523453: Obviously there are things we have to do to help him but [%person#1-I] don't think communication will be a problem at any time
STR-1:

KEY-523454: He needs to learn fast, but that's the case for anyone in his situation. It's part of the process
STR-1:

KEY-523455: We'll be helping him but yeah, [%person#1-I] hope he learns quickly
STR-1:

KEY-523456: [%person#1-I] know stuff like this takes time and [%person#1-I]'m prepared to give him as much as he needs
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-523466: As far as [%person#1-I]'m concerned, he's worth every penny we paid, and then some
STR-1:

KEY-523467: You have to pay to get quality and that's the case here. The talent justifies the outlay
STR-1:

KEY-523468: He's got the quality to justify the fee we've paid and [%person#1-I] know he'll prove it on the pitch in {an}[%team#1-short] shirt
STR-1:

KEY-523469: We spent what we had to in order to bring him here. Now it's his job to prove he was worth it
STR-1:

KEY-523470: At the end of the day, the player has to prove himself worthy of that fee. We'll help him do that
STR-1:

KEY-523471: This is where the hard work begins for [%male#2-first]. He has to put in the work to make sure he lives up to expectations
STR-1:

KEY-523472: The price tag is inescapable for [%male#2-first] and only hard work on his part will determine whether or not it's seen as a good deal
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-523480: They're both outstanding players and [%person#1-I] fully intend for them to play together. Why wouldn't [%person#1-I]?

STR-1:

KEY-523486: [%person#1-I] want to run a meritocracy here. The best players will play
STR-1:

KEY-523487: If a player deserves to play, he will. [%person#1-I] want these decisions to be based on merit rather than reputation
STR-1:

KEY-523488: Is it fair to say that [%male#2] was signed to fill a specific need [%position#2-sentence]?

KEY-523494: [%person#1-I]'m not going to get into why we signed him
STR-1:

KEY-523495: [%person#1-I] think it was clear we needed to improve in that position and [%male#2-first] brings the quality we want there
STR-1:

KEY-523496: We knew where we wanted to upgrade and we knew the player we wanted to bring in. [%male#2-First] ticked all the boxes
STR-1:

KEY-523497: We certainly hope he solves some problems! That's why we made this deal
STR-1:

KEY-523498: [%male#2-First] has the right attributes to come into this team and help us out. If that takes us to a new level [%person#1-I]'ll be pleased
STR-1:

KEY-523499: He brings quality at the end of the day. That's no slight on anyone else we already have in the squad; we're always trying to get better
STR-1:

KEY-523500: We have confidence in all of our players but, when a player of [%male#2-first]{s} quality is available, you have to do that deal
STR-1:

KEY-523501: It's not about filling needs or solving problems, it's about having quality of depth

KEY-523509: [%person#1-I]'m not looking that far ahead right now
STR-1:

KEY-523510: [%person#1-I]'d like us to keep him long-term; it would mean that he's been a success and wanted to stay here too
STR-1:

KEY-523511: [%person#1-I] like him, that's why [%person#1-I]'ve brought him in, and if he's good enough and willing to stay, why not?
STR-1:

KEY-523512: We'd all like to hope he has a long-term future here so, if everything works out well, we'll try to make that happen
STR-1:

KEY-523513: It'd be nice if this was the first step towards a long-term future here. If all parties want it and it makes sense, we can look into it
STR-1:

KEY-523514: Let's wait and see, shall we? It's far too early to be having those conversations
STR-1:

KEY-523515: He's only just joined! Let's see how things go before getting into that discussion
STR-1:

KEY-523516: It's just a loan deal for now; [%person#1-I] won't be drawn on anything else at this stage
STR-1:

KEY-523517: It's a loan deal and nothing more as far as [%person#1-I]'m concerned
STR-1:

KEY-523518: What are the chances [%person#1-you] take up the option to buy in [%male#2]{s} loan deal?
STR-1:

KEY-523519: Do [%person#1-you] think there's a realistic chance that the club will trigger [%male#2]{s} option to buy at the end of this loan?
STR-1:

KEY-523520: [%person#1-surname] wants to sign [%male#2-surname] permanently
STR-1:

KEY-523521: [%person#1-surname] hopes for permanent [%male#2-surname] deal
STR-1:

KEY-523522: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] will show us whether he's worth buying or not
STR-1:

KEY-523523: [%person#1-surname] doubts [%team#1-short] will take up [%male#2-surname] option
STR-1:

KEY-523524: That's a long way away yet. [%person#1-I]'m just happy to have him at the club
STR-1:

KEY-523525: [%person#1-I] would like to make it a permanent deal, we wanted the option, and if it all comes together [%person#1-I]'ll be happy
STR-1:

KEY-523526: We wanted the option to make it permanent because we know how good of a player he is and [%person#1-I]'d be happy if it all came together
STR-1:

KEY-523527: [%person#1-I]'d like to be in that position come the end of the loan because it would mean he's been a success
STR-1:

KEY-523528: If we do end up triggering that option it'll be because he's proven his quality for the club, and [%person#1-I] hope that happens
STR-1:

KEY-523529: [%person#1-I]'m not going to get drawn into that right now but it's safe to say his performances will show us whether we go down that path or not
STR-1:

KEY-523530: It's up to [%male#2-first] now. His performances will show us what steps to take
STR-1:

KEY-523531: [%person#1-I] won't go as far as saying it's an outright no but [%person#1-I] don't think anyone's expecting that to happen
STR-1:

KEY-523532: As far as [%person#1-I] know right now this is just a loan deal, and it won't go any further than that
STR-1:

KEY-523533: How reflective of [%person#1-your] future planning is the obligation to make [%male#2]{s} loan deal a permanent arrangement?
STR-1:

KEY-523534: [%male#2] arrives on loan with an obligation to buy. How does that affect [%person#1-your] future plans?
STR-1:

KEY-523535: [%person#1-surname] expects [%male#2-surname] to help [%team#1-short] for many years
STR-1:

KEY-523536: [%person#1-surname] hopes to see [%male#2-surname] take the next step
STR-1:

KEY-523537: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] must prove himself at [%team#1-short]
STR-1:

KEY-523538: [%person#1-surname] discusses [%male#2-surname]{s} obligation to buy
STR-1:

KEY-523539: [%person#1-I] don't view it like that; we've got a new signing, however you want to frame it
STR-1:

KEY-523540: As far as [%person#1-I]'m concerned, [%male#2-first] is {an}[%team#1-short] player who will help us for many years to come
STR-1:

KEY-523541: [%person#1-I] know the paperwork says otherwise, but he's our player now, and he'll help us for many years
STR-1:

KEY-523542: [%person#1-I] hope he can take the next step. We've put our faith in him as a club and we can hopefully make progress together
STR-1:

KEY-523543: The future is bright for all of us. We trust that this is the right deal and we can take the next step forward together
STR-1:

KEY-523544: He has to go and prove himself to the club and to the fans. It could have been just a loan but we believe in his talent
STR-1:

KEY-523545: We wanted to make sure we arranged a permanent deal as part of the loan and [%male#2-first] now has to prove that we made the right decision
STR-1:

KEY-523546: It's a bit of a risk; we could've taken the safe road with a straight loan deal, but we've made our choice, and [%person#1-I] look forward to seeing what happens
STR-1:

KEY-523547: The obligation to buy works against a club if the loan doesn't work out, but [%person#1-I] like to take risks, and we'll see if we get our rewards now
STR-1:

KEY-523548: How important will it be for [%male#2] to get to learn from someone like [%male#3]?
STR-1:

KEY-523549: Do [%person#1-you] think there's a real opportunity for [%male#2] to learn from someone like [%male#3]?

STR-1:

KEY-523551: [%person#1-surname] wants to see [%male#2-surname] flourish alongside [%male#3-surname]
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-523553: [%person#1-surname] says [%male#2-surname] will learn 'from everyone'
STR-1:

KEY-523554: That's not something [%person#1-I] pay much attention to, it's more of a nice story for the media to create
STR-1:

KEY-523555: There isn't a better player to learn from in [%person#1-my] opinion. [%male#2-first] will get a real education
STR-1:

KEY-523556: It's a really good opportunity for [%male#2-first] to raise his game even further working with someone as good as [%male#3-first]
STR-1:

KEY-523557: [%person#1-I] hope they can work together and [%person#1-I] want to see [%male#2-first] flourish into the same sort of player
STR-1:

KEY-523558: [%person#1-I] think and hope [%male#2-first] can flourish now he gets to work with [%male#3-first] every single day
STR-1:

KEY-523559: [%person#1-I] understand why people draw those comparisons, but [%male#2-first] is his own player, and [%person#1-I] don't want to put undue pressure on him
STR-1:

KEY-523560: Of course they'll learn from each other but [%person#1-I] don't want people thinking that's why we signed [%male#2-first]. He's very much here on merit
STR-1:

KEY-523561: He'll get to learn from everyone here, that's the environment we have. [%male#3-first] will contribute just as much as anyone else
STR-1:

KEY-523562: [%person#1-I] think he'll learn from everyone, that's what [%person#1-I] want to happen. We have a really good group of players
STR-1:

KEY-523563: Can [%male#2] become as good as someone like [%male#3] in the annals of [%team#1-short] history?
STR-1:

KEY-523564: Do [%person#1-you] think [%male#2] will go down in [%team#1-short] history with the likes of [%male#3] when it's all said and done?
STR-1:

KEY-523565: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] can be {an}[%team#1-short] legend
STR-1:

KEY-523566: [%person#1-surname]: Sky's the limit for [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-523567: [%person#1-surname] eases pressure on [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-523568: [%person#1-surname] rubbishes legend comparisons for [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-523569: [%person#1-I] really don't think this is the time to be talking about that!
STR-1:

KEY-523570: [%person#1-I] have every confidence that he can write his name into [%team#1-short] legend, yeah
STR-1:

KEY-523571: [%person#1-I] don't see a reason why he can't be as good as someone like [%male#3-first] was for this club. He's got everything
STR-1:

KEY-523572: The sky's the limit for him. He can establish himself as a legend in his own right
STR-1:

KEY-523573: [%person#1-I] think the sky truly is the limit for him. [%male#3-first] was a star in his own right but [%male#2-first] can do great things
STR-1:

KEY-523574: [%person#1-I] don't think any player needs that sort of pressure upon arrival at a club, but [%person#1-I] am excited about what he can bring to the table
STR-1:

KEY-523575: Those are some lofty comparisons that [%person#1-I] wouldn't make [%person#1-myself], but [%person#1-I] do think he's going to be great for us
STR-1:

KEY-523576: We don't need to talk about past legends right now. [%male#2-first] is a great signing and will be a tremendous asset for us
STR-1:

KEY-523577: [%person#1-I]'ll leave the legend comparisons to people on social media. [%person#1-I]'m just happy to have him here
STR-1:

KEY-523578: Would [%person#1-you] say that [%male#2] helps the club work towards its long-term vision?
STR-1:

KEY-523579: Do [%person#1-you] think this is the type of signing that will help [%team#1-short] realise its long-term club vision?
STR-1:

KEY-523580: [%male#2-surname] 'shows what we're about', says [%person#1-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-523581: [%person#1-surname] feels [%male#2-surname] will take [%team#1-short] forward
STR-1:

KEY-523582: [%person#1-surname] discusses [%male#2-surname] and club vision
STR-1:

KEY-523583: [%person#1-surname] considers big picture after signing [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-523584: Everything we do is driven by our long-term goals as far as [%person#1-I]'m concerned
STR-1:

KEY-523585: This is the type of signing that shows everyone what we're about. We're aligned as a club and working towards our objectives every day
STR-1:

KEY-523586: [%person#1-I] think this shows off our intent. We have clear objectives and, when you can sign a player like [%male#2-first], it means we're meeting them
STR-1:

KEY-523587: [%person#1-I] think [%male#2-first] can take us forward and help us become the club we want to be, for sure
STR-1:

KEY-523588: If we want to make our long-terms goals happen, we have to improve, and we have to bring in players like [%male#2-first]
STR-1:

KEY-523589: There are a lot of moving parts to a long-term vision, and moves that we make today may not seem like they work towards it, but they eventually do
STR-1:

KEY-523590: [%person#1-I] have the long-term in mind, but [%person#1-I] can't look too far ahead, and have to remain present. [%male#2-first] will certainly help us right away
STR-1:

KEY-523591: This is a real long-term process we're embarking on here, and [%person#1-I] don't want to lose sight of the big picture. All the small steps add up
STR-1:

KEY-523592: Some people might not see how a move like this works with our stated long-term aims, but [%person#1-I] would ask them to look back on it in a few years and evaluate it then
STR-1:

KEY-523593: [%person#2-You]'ve worked with [%male#2] before, of course. How do [%person#1-you] think his game has changed since then?
STR-1:

KEY-523594: How much do [%person#1-you] think [%male#2] has changed as a footballer since [%person#1-you] last worked with him?
STR-1:

KEY-523595: [%person#1-surname] says [%male#2-surname] is 'better than ever'
STR-1:

KEY-523596: [%person#1-surname] proud of [%male#2-surname]{s} progress
STR-1:

KEY-523597: [%person#1-surname] happy to work with [%male#2-surname] again
STR-1:

KEY-523598: [%person#1-surname]: You know what you're getting with [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-523599: [%person#1-I]'d say it's more about how much [%person#1-I]'ve changed!
STR-1:

KEY-523600: Oh he's better than ever. He was really good then but we're getting a top, top player now
STR-1:

KEY-523601: To [%person#1-me], he's better than ever. He just keeps on improving
STR-1:

KEY-523602: [%person#1-I]'m really proud of his journey and really excited to work with a player who is mastering his craft
STR-1:

KEY-523603: He sees more of the game now and understands how he fits into the puzzle. [%person#1-I]'m proud of who he's become
STR-1:

KEY-523604: [%person#1-I] don't know how much he's changed but [%person#1-I]'m very happy to be working with him again
STR-1:

KEY-523605: It's not always about change; [%person#1-I] trust him and [%person#1-I]'m happy to work with him again
STR-1:

KEY-523606: You know what you're getting with [%male#2-first]. He gives [%person#1-me] confidence when he's on the pitch
STR-1:

KEY-523607: [%male#2-first] doesn't change a lot, but he's so reliable and you know what you're getting, so that's not a bad thing at all
STR-1:

KEY-523608: Do [%person#1-you] think you now have too many players [%position#1-sentence]?
STR-1:

KEY-523609: Does this deal leave [%person#1-you] with too many options [%position#1-sentence]?
STR-1:

KEY-523610: [%person#1-surname] expecting to trim squad after signing [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-523611: [%person#1-surname] will balance [%male#2-surname]{s} arrival against planned exits
STR-1:

KEY-523612: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] gives us quality in depth
STR-1:

KEY-523613: [%person#1-surname] adds [%male#2-surname] to 'quality options'
STR-1:

KEY-523614: [%person#1-I]'m not going to get into a debate about [%person#1-my] squad right now
STR-1:

KEY-523615: [%person#1-I]'m already planning to trim the squad appropriately
STR-1:

KEY-523616: We probably do have an excess of options in that position now so we'll probably look to trim the numbers a bit
STR-1:

KEY-523617: That's something [%person#1-I]'m working to balance out; we'll have the right squad make-up eventually
STR-1:

KEY-523618: [%person#1-I] know [%person#1-I] need to balance out the numbers there and that'll come in due course
STR-1:

KEY-523619: [%person#1-I] wouldn't say we have too many players; [%male#2-first] gives us quality in depth now
STR-1:

KEY-523620: [%person#1-I]'d disagree with that a little, we have quality in depth, that's the way [%person#1-I] look at it
STR-1:

KEY-523621: [%person#1-I]'m in the business of adding quality options to [%person#1-my] squad and [%person#1-I]'ll continue to do that
STR-1:

KEY-523622: You can never have too many options! [%person#1-I] want quality and that's what [%person#1-I] have now
STR-1:

KEY-523623: [%male#2] returns for his [%number#2-nth] loan spell at [%stadium#1]. Why have [%person#1-you] opted for another temporary deal?
STR-1:

KEY-523624: Questions are being asked as to why [%male#2] has been brought back on loan again rather than on a permanent basis. Can [%person#1-you] explain why?
STR-1:

KEY-523625: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] brings quality we can't afford
STR-1:

KEY-523626: [%person#1-surname] helping to develop [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-523627: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] is our best option
STR-1:

KEY-523628: [%person#1-surname] doesn't want to sign [%male#2-surname] permanently
STR-1:

KEY-523629: [%person#1-I] don't think we need to get into that today
STR-1:

KEY-523630: He has quality that we can't afford to buy permanently, but we can rent. [%person#1-I] can't tell you how invaluable that is
STR-1:

KEY-523631: [%person#1-I]'d love to sign him permanently but we can't afford to. This way, [%person#1-I] still get a quality player
STR-1:

KEY-523632: Of course we've got a top player but we're doing our part in helping his development too. We play a big role
STR-1:

KEY-523633: We've been entrusted with his development and [%person#1-I] think it's very much a win-win relationship
STR-1:

KEY-523634: He's our best option, whether it's a loan or a permanent deal. [%person#1-I]'ll take him however he comes here
STR-1:

KEY-523635: It's clear he's our best option and [%person#1-I] will take whatever deal that gets him in {an}[%team#1-short] shirt
STR-1:

KEY-523636: [%person#1-I] don't think we need to sign him permanently but, right now, he fits what we want to do
STR-1:

KEY-523637: Perhaps we don't want to strike a permanent deal? There are lots of factors to consider but [%person#1-I]'m doing what the club needs most at this time
STR-1:

KEY-523638: [%male#2] is the latest player to join [%team#1-short] from [%team#2-short]. Why do [%person#1-you] keep returning to that particular well?
STR-1:

KEY-523639: What makes [%person#1-you] keep returning to [%team#2-short] for new signings; [%male#2] being the latest to make the journey from [%stadium#2]?
STR-1:

KEY-523640: [%person#1-surname]: [%team#2-short] produce quality players
STR-1:

KEY-523641: [%person#1-surname] values [%team#2-short] relationship
STR-1:

KEY-523642: [%person#1-surname] talks about [%team#2-short] 'coincidence'
STR-1:

KEY-523643: [%person#1-surname]: We'll sign players from anywhere
STR-1:

KEY-523644: [%person#1-I] can't say [%person#1-I]'d noticed!
STR-1:

KEY-523645: They produce so many good players, why would [%person#1-I] not want to shop there?
STR-1:

KEY-523646: [%person#1-I] want to bring top-quality players to the club and they have an abundance of them. It makes sense
STR-1:

KEY-523647: [%person#1-I]'ve developed a good relationship with the people there and [%person#1-I] think they recognise we do good business too
STR-1:

KEY-523648: [%person#1-I] think they develop really good footballers and [%person#1-I] have a strong working relationship with the people there
STR-1:

KEY-523649: [%person#1-I] think it's a coincidence as much as anything else. It just happens that the deals we've done involve [%team#2-short]
STR-1:

KEY-523650: The simplest answer is often the right one; [%person#1-I] think it's a coincidence. We've done a lot of business and [%team#2-short] feature a lot in that
STR-1:

KEY-523651: [%person#1-I]'ll sign players from anywhere, there's nothing special to this trend, that's the way it is
STR-1:

KEY-523652: [%person#1-I]'d have signed these players whoever they played for. There's no story behind this, [%person#1-I] promise
STR-1:

KEY-523653: [%male#2] really impressed the last time [%team#1-short] met [%team#2-short]. How much did that performance influence [%person#1-your] decision to sign him?
STR-1:

KEY-523654: How much did [%male#2]{s} performance against [%team#1-short] last time out influence this deal?
STR-1:

KEY-523655: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] confirmed his quality against us
STR-1:

KEY-523656: [%person#1-surname] 'wanted to sign' [%male#2-surname] after previous meeting
STR-1:

KEY-523657: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] was a long-term target
STR-1:

KEY-523658: [%person#1-surname] says [%male#2-surname] deal only came about recently
STR-1:

KEY-523659: It doesn't matter what [%person#1-I] say, you've already written your headlines!
STR-1:

KEY-523660: That performance confirmed his quality and it's safe to say we made our move shortly afterwards
STR-1:

KEY-523661: He was outstanding that day and confirmed his quality, if it needed confirming at that stage
STR-1:

KEY-523662: [%person#1-I] decided at some point during that match that [%person#1-I] wanted to sign him so we didn't have to face him anymore!
STR-1:

KEY-523663: That match made [%person#1-me] sit up and take notice. We definitely wanted to sign him from then on
STR-1:

KEY-523664: He was a long-term target of ours and that performance was just more evidence that we were in for the right player
STR-1:

KEY-523665: [%person#1-I] can assure you that he was a long-term target and that game just validated everything we thought about him
STR-1:

KEY-523666: Honestly, we only really started looking into him recently. Obviously he was good against us but that wasn't a lightbulb moment or anything
STR-1:

KEY-523667: This is a deal that only came together recently but, yes, with hindsight he might have influenced us subconsciously that day
STR-1:

KEY-523668: Can a young player like [%male#2] break into the first team in the near future?
STR-1:

KEY-523669: Will [%male#2] be able to break into the first team relatively quickly or do [%person#1-you] think he's a more long-term prospect?
STR-1:

KEY-523670: [%person#1-surname] expects [%male#2-surname] to make instant impact
STR-1:

KEY-523671: [%person#1-surname] believes [%male#2-surname] can make swift impact
STR-1:

KEY-523672: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] will have to be patient
STR-1:

KEY-523673: [%person#1-surname] expects [%male#2-surname] to take longer to develop
STR-1:

KEY-523674: [%person#1-I] don't think we need to make those projections on day one
STR-1:

KEY-523675: He's good enough to come in and make an instant impact and that's what [%person#1-I]'ll be challenging him to do
STR-1:

KEY-523676: [%person#1-I] think he has everything needed to come in and be an instant success
STR-1:

KEY-523677: [%person#1-I] honestly believe he can make a swift and decisive improvement to the team, at least, [%person#1-I] hope so!
STR-1:

KEY-523678: We've signed him to make a swift improvement to the team and he's got enough in his game to give it a real good go
STR-1:

KEY-523679: We'll all have to be patient and be careful not to expect too much too soon. His time will come
STR-1:

KEY-523680: [%person#1-I] completely endorse his quality but we'll have to be patient before we see the best of him
STR-1:

KEY-523681: He's going to take a little longer to come along than a lot of players but he'll be worth the wait
STR-1:

KEY-523682: [%person#1-I] know we'll have to wait a bit longer to see the best of him but, when he gets there, watch out
STR-1:

KEY-523683: Can we expect [%male#2] to get more first-team opportunities now he's signed a new contract?
STR-1:

KEY-523684: Can [%male#2] expect more first-team football after signing a new deal?
STR-1:

KEY-523685: We all expect big things from him and those opportunities will come with time
STR-1:

KEY-523686: He's made a very strong case for himself, he's signed a new deal, and he'll continue to move forwards now
STR-1:

KEY-523687: It's really exciting for him to sign a new deal, his time will come, and we'll make sure he gets that push at the right moment
STR-1:

KEY-523688: He's someone who has a tremendous future at the club and we'll make sure he gets to take the next step at the right time
STR-1:

KEY-523689: We need to be patient right now; it's exciting that he's committed his future to us but there's work to be done before he's ready
STR-1:

KEY-523690: It's really important to stay patient; we have a strong squad and, while he's doing well, there's a way for him to go yet
STR-1:

KEY-523691: His future is definitely with [%team#1-short] but we have to be responsible with him, and he has to be responsible himself too. That will all come with time
STR-1:

KEY-523692: People can react differently to signing new contracts and we're going to have to see how he responds; will he be responsible and work even harder or not?
STR-1:

KEY-523693: [%male#2]{s} goal was a bit special, wasn't it?
STR-1:

KEY-523694: What did [%person#1-you] think of [%male#2]{s} goal?
STR-1:

KEY-523695: It was absolutely brilliant, what a great goal!
STR-1:

KEY-523696: That was a moment of real quality that'll live long in the memory
STR-1:

KEY-523697: He's got it in his locker and [%person#1-I]'ve been waiting for something like that!
STR-1:

KEY-523698: [%person#1-I] can't think of a better goal [%person#1-I]'ve seen recently
STR-1:

KEY-523699: The goal gets the attention, deservedly so, but [%person#1-I] thought he was good value all-round with his performance
STR-1:

KEY-523700: His performance warranted that goal, that's what [%person#1-I] was most pleased with
STR-1:

KEY-523701: [%person#1-I]'m the wrong person to ask, that sort of thing is lost on [%person#1-me]!
STR-1:

KEY-523702: They all count, whether they're the scrappiest goal ever, or impressive ones like that
STR-1:

KEY-523703: Were [%person#1-you] impressed with the goal [%male#2] scored against [%person#1-your] team today?
STR-1:

KEY-523704: How good was that goal from [%male#2], even though it was scored against [%person#1-your] team?
STR-1:

KEY-523705: It was a great goal, there's no denying it
STR-1:

KEY-523706: He's scored an absolutely beauty there, unfortunately for us
STR-1:

KEY-523707: [%person#1-I] think everyone can appreciate a goal of that calibre
STR-1:

KEY-523708: Obviously [%person#1-I]'d rather he'd have not scored, but yeah, great goal
STR-1:

KEY-523709: [%person#1-I] thought we made it easy for him and that's disappointing from [%person#1-my] perspective
STR-1:

KEY-523710: [%person#1-I] know everyone's raving about the goal but [%person#1-I] can't accept that we allowed it to happen
STR-1:

KEY-523711: [%person#1-I]'m not going to come out here and praise a goal that made life harder for us
STR-1:

KEY-523712: [%person#1-I] didn't really think that much of it to be honest with you
STR-1:

KEY-523713: How good was [%male#2] for the opposition today?
STR-1:

KEY-523714: [%male#2] was superb for [%team#2-short]. How unfortunate was it to face him in that kind of form?
STR-1:

KEY-523715: Do [%person#1-you] have to sit back and admire when an opposition player puts in a performance like [%male#2]{s} today?
STR-1:

KEY-523716: [%male#2] has earned plenty of plaudits for his performance today. Do [%person#1-you] agree he was a cut above any of [%person#1-your] players today?
STR-1:

KEY-523717: We couldn't get near him. He was superb throughout
STR-1:

KEY-523718: He's a top player and top players have these games from time to time. He blew us away in truth
STR-1:

KEY-523719: We appreciate how good he is. The biggest compliment [%person#1-I] can pay him is the fact his name is being said in our dressing room right now. We had no answer for him today
STR-1:

KEY-523720: It's hard to disagree with that statement. [%person#1-I]'ll be passing on the tape of his performance for [%person#1-my] players to replicate
STR-1:

KEY-523721: He was very good. We understood [%team#2-short]{s} quality pre-match and we were unable to stop him in particular
STR-1:

KEY-523722: [%person#1-I] was hoping he'd spare us that performance! It goes without saying the quality he has which was on full display today
STR-1:

KEY-523723: There's no doubting his quality. We have to accept he's tough to stop when he reaches this level of performance
STR-1:

KEY-523724: [%person#1-I] wouldn't mind him in [%person#1-my] team! The praise is justified as he was on the top of his game
STR-1:

KEY-523725: He played well but others matched him too
STR-1:

KEY-523726: He was okay. There were others on the opposition that played just as well
STR-1:

KEY-523727: [%person#1-I] thought he was good but [%person#1-I]'m here to answer questions on [%person#1-my] own team
STR-1:

KEY-523728: [%person#1-I] agree he did well but [%person#1-I] think we allowed him to flourish
STR-1:

KEY-523729: He was good but we possess quality players too. [%person#1-I]'m not here to be drawn on comparisons
STR-1:

KEY-523730: [%person#1-I] think the question should be centred around how we allowed him to play. We made him look good
STR-1:

KEY-523731: [%person#1-I] didn't see anything special from him. You clearly viewed his performance differently
STR-1:

KEY-523732: If you believe [%person#1-I] sit back and admire a performance from an opponent then you've got your head in the sand. You're an ostrich, that's what you are
STR-1:

KEY-523733: To praise him to the high heavens would be disrespectful to [%person#1-my] players and that's not [%person#1-my] style
STR-1:

KEY-523734: How good was [%male#2] today?
STR-1:

KEY-523735: Just how impressed were you with [%male#2]?
STR-1:

KEY-523736: [%person#1-I] thought he was imperious and put in the sort of performance that we know he's capable of
STR-1:

KEY-523737: What a performance; it was top quality from a top player
STR-1:

KEY-523738: [%person#1-I]'m pleased he played well as that's what we want from him
STR-1:

KEY-523739: He put in a good shift and impacted the game positively for us
STR-1:

KEY-523740: Honestly? [%person#1-I]'ve seen him play like that before and [%person#1-I] know he can do even better
STR-1:

KEY-523741: He was good, but we don't need to go overboard with the praise. That's the minimum we expect from him
STR-1:

KEY-523742: It wasn't one of his better performances in [%person#1-my] opinion, which makes the sort of praise he's getting a bit confusing
STR-1:

KEY-523743: He was alright, but [%person#1-I] know he's capable of a lot more, and he'll be the first to tell you all that
STR-1:

KEY-523744: How good was [%male#2] out there today?
STR-1:

KEY-523745: [%person#1-You] can't have faced many better opposition performances than [%male#2]{s}?
STR-1:

KEY-523746: He was outstanding, full credit to him
STR-1:

KEY-523747: [%person#1-I] thought he was brilliant, unfortunately for us
STR-1:

KEY-523748: He played very well and he can be pleased with his performance
STR-1:

KEY-523749: He had a very good game and we knew he was capable of that
STR-1:

KEY-523750: We made him look better than he is, and [%person#1-I] say that with all due respect
STR-1:

KEY-523751: Most players would look that good if we afforded them the comfort we gave him today
STR-1:

KEY-523752: [%person#1-I] thought he was alright but that's just [%person#1-my] opinion
STR-1:

KEY-523753: [%male#2] put in a good performance today. Do [%person#1-you] think that's likely to swell the potential interest surrounding him?
STR-1:

KEY-523754: With [%male#2-surname] the subject of much transfer speculation, what impact do [%person#1-you] think [%male#2-first]{s} performance today will have?
STR-1:

KEY-523755: [%person#1-I] don't have any worries about [%male#2-surname] staying. He played well and he'll continue to play for us
STR-1:

KEY-523756: [%male#2] put in a great performance today and he'll be staying at the club. He's going nowhere
STR-1:

KEY-523757: [%person#1-I] think there's every chance of him remaining here, [%person#1-I]'ve seen nothing to suggest he'll leave
STR-1:

KEY-523758: [%person#1-I] don't think he'll be going anywhere in a hurry, particularly if he keeps putting in performances like that
STR-1:

KEY-523759: [%person#1-I] think there's definitely some pull from elsewhere, [%person#1-I]'m not too sure whether we can keep him long-term
STR-1:

KEY-523760: Nobody knows the future for certain. We'll have to see what happens
STR-1:

KEY-523761: [%person#1-I]'ll be honest and say that it's probably quite likely that he'll leave at some point, but we're not sure when that might happen
STR-1:

KEY-523762: It's looking quite likely that [%male#2]{s} future might lie elsewhere
STR-1:

KEY-523763: Do [%person#1-you] think the list of suitors for [%male#2-surname] might grow after a performance like that?
STR-1:

KEY-523764: Will [%male#2]{s} performance increase any interest in his availability and lead to any firm bids?
STR-1:

KEY-523765: [%person#1-I] would expect to see some people sit up and take notice of what [%male#2-first] can do after today, so it wouldn't surprise me
STR-1:

KEY-523766: It's the type of performance that often tips indecision into action, so there might be some movement soon
STR-1:

KEY-523767: You never know. [%person#1-I] would have thought so but you can never second guess anyone, especially in football
STR-1:

KEY-523768: [%person#1-I]'d be a little surprised if people watching that didn't have their interest piqued
STR-1:

KEY-523769: [%person#1-I] think people will wait to see a player's overall form rather than looking at an individual match, regardless of how well they played
STR-1:

KEY-523770: It will probably take a few more performances like that before any interest in [%male#2-surname] becomes more concrete
STR-1:

KEY-523771: [%person#1-I] doubt it, isolated matches rarely result in any concrete interest
STR-1:

KEY-523772: [%male#2] had a cracking game today. Are performances like that likely to persuade [%person#1-you] to try and make the deal permanent?
STR-1:

KEY-523773: Will [%person#1-you] be giving any serious consideration to making [%male#2]{s} loan spell a more permanent one?
STR-1:

KEY-523774: Everyone saw his quality today and it's definitely something [%person#1-I]'ll be investigating. We'd love to have him with us
STR-1:

KEY-523775: [%person#1-I] think it's definitely something the club needs to give serious consideration to. [%person#1-I] know how highly [%person#1-I] rate him
STR-1:

KEY-523776: [%person#1-I]'m always looking to add quality to [%person#1-my] teams so yes, it's something we'll look into
STR-1:

KEY-523777: [%male#2-first] had a great game today and if that continues [%person#1-I]'d be foolish not to consider bringing him in on a permanent basis
STR-1:

KEY-523778: We'll definitely investigate but [%person#1-I]'m not confident of our chances
STR-1:

KEY-523779: [%person#1-I]'ll try [%person#1-my] hardest to make it happen, but [%person#1-I] should probably warn people that it's quite unlikely
STR-1:

KEY-523780: [%person#1-I] would love it but we have to be realistic and just make the most of him while we can
STR-1:

KEY-523781: It's very unlikely, [%person#1-I] don't think it would be the right move for a number of reasons
STR-1:

KEY-523782: The use of technology in football has proved divisive among many but it helped [%person#1-you] out today. What are [%person#1-your] thoughts?
STR-1:

KEY-523783: What's [%person#1-your] opinion on the use of technology in football. [%person#1-You] won today but do [%person#1-you] believe it is good for the game??
STR-1:

KEY-523784: It looks like technology gave [%person#1-your] team a little helping hand in getting the result [%person#1-you] wanted today. What do [%person#1-you] make of that?
STR-1:

KEY-523785: Technology is the future. We've seen it vastly improve other sports and it's about time football caught up
STR-1:

KEY-523786: There are a lot of luddites in football sadly who rally against it, but [%person#1-I]'m all for it 'a luddite/luddites' is a person or people who are afraid or working with new methods or technology
STR-1:

KEY-523787: Football is too important to too many to keep getting big decisions wrong. We need technology to ensure entire futures aren't altered by mistakes
STR-1:

KEY-523788: [%person#1-I] like it. It's not perfect yet but we're on the right track and we saw a good example of it working correctly today
STR-1:

KEY-523789: It gives [%person#1-me] hope for the future that more games will see the right result at full time
STR-1:

KEY-523790: It's a big boost, [%person#1-I]'m pleased to see it working and happy it helped us
STR-1:

KEY-523791: In principle [%person#1-I] support the use of technology but [%person#1-I] don't agree with how it's being used currently
STR-1:

KEY-523792: It's the inconsistencies that [%person#1-I] don't understand. We have all this technology available and yet we're still confused
STR-1:

KEY-523793: [%person#1-I] think we need to evaluate how it's being used right now. It's a good idea but it isn't working in its current form
STR-1:

KEY-523794: It works in some situations but in others it seems to be an excuse for extreme pedantry and punishing offences that don't fit with the spirit of the game
STR-1:

KEY-523795: [%person#1-I] can't stand it to be honest, it sucks the emotion and life out of the game
STR-1:

KEY-523796: It's the fans [%person#1-I] feel sorry for, decisions are communicated poorly and the time they take to resolve is too long
STR-1:

KEY-523797: The technology will always be flawed as each situation brings different context and problems, we won't see incorrect decisions or inconsistencies disappear overnight
STR-1:

KEY-523798: We got the win today but [%person#1-I]'m against it, [%person#1-you] can't even celebrate a goal any more without the fear of it being disallowed
STR-1:

KEY-523799: In light of today's events, what are [%person#1-your] thoughts on the increased use of technology to help match officials?
STR-1:

KEY-523800: Even though it worked against [%person#1-you] here, are [%person#1-you] in favour of the increasing use of technology to help officiate matches?
STR-1:

KEY-523801: [%person#1-I] think we always have to be looking forward and find ways to improve the sport. Technology will always be at the heart of that
STR-1:

KEY-523802: [%person#1-I] think it always makes sense to explore new ways to innovate and improve the sport and [%person#1-I]'m certainly in favour of the sort of things we currently see happening
STR-1:

KEY-523803: If the outcome is fair and just, [%person#1-I]'m happy, however we get there
STR-1:

KEY-523804: If we can use technology to help produce consistently fair outcomes then [%person#1-I]'ll be happy. That's what it all comes down to
STR-1:

KEY-523805: [%person#1-I] don't have a problem with the use of technology in principle, but it has to enhance the game, not make it more tedious
STR-1:

KEY-523806: There definitely seems to be a split as to whether technology is a help or a hindrance; [%person#1-I]'m generally in favour but there has to be strict limits and more efficient use
STR-1:

KEY-523807: It's not for [%person#1-me]; we've ended up on the wrong side of technology today and [%person#1-I] don't think it's fair or consistent
STR-1:

KEY-523808: [%person#1-I]'d just as soon get rid of it altogether; look what happened today
STR-1:

KEY-523809: What does [%male#2]{s} winner mean to the team?
STR-1:

KEY-523810: Will [%male#2]{s} winner have a galvanising effect on the team?
STR-1:

KEY-523811: It was a huge goal, the sort of moment that can change a season
STR-1:

KEY-523812: Everyone is absolutely delighted with that win and it's going to do our morale the world of good
STR-1:

KEY-523813: [%person#1-I] think those moments are always uplifting, it's why we all do this
STR-1:

KEY-523814: We all enjoy a celebration and a good time and goals like that give us even more motivation to go on and improve
STR-1:

KEY-523815: Let's see how we react to that now, that's the big question. Do we use it as a reason to kick on, or will some players grow complacent?
STR-1:

KEY-523816: We need to make sure that we don't get carried away and lose focus. We have to really stay on course now
STR-1:

KEY-523817: [%person#1-I] think the goal might mask some issues that [%person#1-I] wasn't happy with, and we need to cut out silly mistakes
STR-1:

KEY-523818: As nice of a moment as it was, [%person#1-I] can't shake off all the things we did wrong, and [%person#1-I] certainly won't let us rest on our laurels
STR-1:

KEY-523819: Can [%person#1-you] talk about [%person#1-your] reaction to [%male#2]{s} late goal?
STR-1:

KEY-523820: How did you feel when [%male#2] scored late on for [%person#1-your] team?
STR-1:

KEY-523821: That's why we all fell in love with football; those moments are the ones we remember
STR-1:

KEY-523822: [%person#1-I] was delighted and it was the least we deserved
STR-1:

KEY-523823: [%person#1-I] was pleased because we deserved that goal
STR-1:

KEY-523824: We worked hard for that, we got the reward, and [%person#1-I]'m pleased
STR-1:

KEY-523825: We shouldn't have had to wait so long for it, it wasn't a good performance
STR-1:

KEY-523826: [%person#1-I] thought we should've scored a lot earlier and it's frustrating that we had to wait so long
STR-1:

KEY-523827: [%person#1-I]'m happy with the goal but not with the performance
STR-1:

KEY-523828: The goal came at a good time, but [%person#1-I] thought we were poor in a lot of areas, and we have to go away and improve on that
STR-1:

KEY-523829: What sort of reaction are [%person#1-you] expecting after conceding to [%male#2]{s} late winner?
STR-1:

KEY-523830: Are [%person#1-you] concerned about how [%person#1-your] players might react to such a late defeat?
STR-1:

KEY-523831: We'll bounce back, there was a lot to by happy with, even if the result wasn't what we wanted
STR-1:

KEY-523832: [%person#1-I] think we'll be fine, there was a lot [%person#1-I] was pleased with in that performance
STR-1:

KEY-523833: It's never nice to lose like that, especially when we deserved more, but [%person#1-I] think we'll be fine
STR-1:

KEY-523834: We know we deserved more so it's up to us to channel that frustration positively
STR-1:

KEY-523835: [%person#1-I] was more disappointed with the performance; we deserved to lose, and now we have to respond
STR-1:

KEY-523836: [%person#1-I] think we had it coming to us and now we have to respond in the right way
STR-1:

KEY-523837: It'll be hard to lift the spirits after such a blow but that's what [%person#1-I]'m paid to do
STR-1:

KEY-523838: [%person#1-I] hope it doesn't dent our confidence too much; we need to forget all about it and focus on our next match
STR-1:

KEY-523839: Just how good was [%male#2] and how important was his hat-trick to winning that match?
STR-1: [%male#2] giỏi đến đâu và hat-trick của anh ấy quan trọng thế nào trong trận thắng đó?

KEY-523840: [%person#1-You] must be absolutely delighted with [%male#2]{s} hat-trick?
STR-1: [%person#1-You] chắc hẳn rất vui với cú hat-trick của [% male # 2]?

KEY-523841: [%person#1-I]'m running out of words to praise him with. He's unbelievable!
STR-1:

KEY-523842: He's an outstanding footballer and [%person#1-I] really couldn't be happier. He reaches new levels seemingly every week
STR-1:

KEY-523843: [%person#1-I]'m delighted, he was brilliant today
STR-1:

KEY-523844: He's got top, top quality and [%person#1-I]'m delighted with his performance
STR-1:

KEY-523845: That sort of performance shows what he's capable of. [%person#1-My] job now is to get even more out of him
STR-1:

KEY-523846: [%person#1-I]'m happy, yes, but now [%person#1-I] want to see how much more he can do. We're always looking to improve
STR-1:

KEY-523847: [%person#1-I] felt the hat-trick hid some aspects of his performance that [%person#1-I] wasn't happy with, but we'll work on that
STR-1:

KEY-523848: [%person#1-I] can't really complain, but [%person#1-I] will be working with him to improve in the areas he can and needs to improve in now too
STR-1:

KEY-523849: Did [%male#2]{s} early goal shape the way the match ended up playing out?
STR-1:

KEY-523850: How important was [%male#2]{s} early goal in setting the tone for the rest of the match?
STR-1:

KEY-523851: [%person#1-I]'m always keen to start well and that was pretty much perfect from our perspective
STR-1:

KEY-523852: An early goal helps so much and [%person#1-I] think it was significant for a lot of reasons today
STR-1:

KEY-523853: The goal settled us down and allowed us to play our game with confidence
STR-1:

KEY-523854: It was a really important moment, we were able to then settle into the game, and play it on our terms
STR-1:

KEY-523855: There was still a lot of the match left at that stage so [%person#1-I] don't know how significant it was
STR-1:

KEY-523856: All it meant is that we then had to play the rest of the match on different terms. It didn't change our focus one bit
STR-1:

KEY-523857: [%person#1-I] think in some ways it made our job harder; suddenly we have the pressure of playing with the lead for a long time
STR-1:

KEY-523858: Such an early goal can sometimes light a fire under the opposition, and that makes things much harder and much less predictable
STR-1:

KEY-523859: [%person#1-Your] side collected a number of cards today. Are [%person#1-you] concerned by the lack of control displayed by your team?
STR-1:

KEY-523860: They played for the shirt. [%person#1-I]'ll never criticise [%person#1-my] players for giving 100%
STR-1:

KEY-523861: The game has well and truly gone. There was a day when we'd be applauded for wearing your heart on your sleeve and not shirking a tackle
STR-1:

KEY-523862: We imposed ourselves on the opposition, [%person#1-I] have no concerns about that
STR-1:

KEY-523863: If you are expecting an apology then you've come to the wrong place. [%person#1-I] have no complaints with the way [%person#1-my] team played
STR-1:

KEY-523864: It's not our preferred approach and [%person#1-I] feel [%person#1-my] players got a bit carried away today
STR-1:

KEY-523865: A couple of them need to think about their actions. [%person#1-I]'m as surprised as you by the performance
STR-1:

KEY-523866: It's not the way [%person#1-I] want [%person#1-my] team playing. Risking fines and suspensions is and never will be [%person#1-my] way of playing
STR-1:

KEY-523867: [%person#1-I] think the referee was card-happy today but [%person#1-I] can't excuse some of the tackles. We'll handle it internally but [%person#1-I]'m hoping this is the last time [%person#1-I] have to answer a question on this topic
STR-1:

KEY-523868: Was [%male#2] frustrated by [%person#1-your] decision to take him off when he was on for a hat-trick?
STR-1:

KEY-523869: [%person#1-I] don't suppose he was happy, but he's a pro and he knows how this works, so there are no problems
STR-1:

KEY-523870: [%person#1-I] wanted to make sure he was given enough rest so as to avoid any potential injury issues. His long-term availability is vital to us
STR-1:

KEY-523871: Ask him whether he was disappointed or not. [%person#1-My] job is to focus on the team and that's what [%person#1-I]'ll continue to do
STR-1:

KEY-523872: If he's more concerned about his own fortunes rather than those of the team then perhaps we'll need to have a little chat
STR-1:

KEY-523873: [%male#2] has now made [%number#1-nth] league appearance for [%team#1-short]. What does he mean to this club?
STR-1:

KEY-523874: He's a tremendous player and an even better person. He represents the very best of [%team#1-short]
STR-1:

KEY-523875: It's a great moment for him and [%person#1-I]'m proud of what he's been able to do for this football club
STR-1:

KEY-523876: It's a wonderful milestone for him to reach, but he'll be the first to tell you that it matters most what you do next, not what you've already done
STR-1:

KEY-523877: [%male#2-surname] has given so much to this club but he'd also be quick to remind everyone that this is a team game, and our collective efforts are the most important thing
STR-1:

KEY-523878: How impressed have [%person#1-you] been with [%male#2], who has now gone [%number#1-text] minutes since he last conceded a goal?
STR-1:

KEY-523879: [%male#2-first] is a dream to work with, he's one of the best goalkeepers around, and it's pleasing to see him getting the sort of credit he deserves
STR-1:

KEY-523880: He's part of a really good defensive unit. It takes a team to make that record possible and goalkeeper to back it up. They work so well together
STR-1:

KEY-523881: We're doing this as a team and, while [%male#2-first] deserves a lot of credit, that same praise should be given to everyone who's played a part in this run
STR-1:

KEY-523882: To be honest it's been a mix of real quality from all of our players, and a bit of luck, but we surely deserve that luck
STR-1:

KEY-523883: Does [%male#2]{s} disciplinary record worry [%person#1-you]? That was his [%number#1-nth] yellow card this season today?
STR-1:

KEY-523884: [%male#2] has now been booked [%number#1-text] times this season. Is that something that worries [%person#1-you]?
STR-1:

KEY-523885: [%person#1-I]'m not worried, he needs to play with an edge to be the player he is, and on balance he provides so much more to the team that way
STR-1:

KEY-523886: [%person#1-I] don't think it's a problem, it's just a part of football, and [%person#1-my] teams will always compete with a combative mentality
STR-1:

KEY-523887: [%person#1-I] know he'll get cards playing in the role and in the manner he plays, and that's something [%person#1-I]'m willing to accept
STR-1:

KEY-523888: [%person#1-I] want him to play in a way that runs the risk of a few cards here and there. [%person#1-I] think the rewards comfortably outweigh the risks
STR-1:

KEY-523889: [%male#2-first] occasionally lets his emotions get the better of him, but that's something we're working to improve
STR-1:

KEY-523890: He plays right on the edge of the rules sometimes, and inevitably there are occasions where he falls foul of them, and so we're trying to refine his approach game by game
STR-1:

KEY-523891: [%person#1-I]'m a little concerned that he's growing too reckless; he needs to channel that energy into other aspects of his game
STR-1:

KEY-523892: [%person#1-I] think we're at the stage where [%person#1-I] might have to do something about it, otherwise we run the risk of losing him for important matches
STR-1:

KEY-523893: How important was it for [%person#1-your] team to score just before half time?
STR-1:

KEY-523894: Was scoring just before half time a decisive moment in the context of the match?
STR-1:

KEY-523895: Goals change games and we all know that goals just before the break make a big difference
STR-1:

KEY-523896: It was a crucial moment and really turned the game in our favour
STR-1:

KEY-523897: That goal changed everything; it gave us the confidence and momentum to go on and win
STR-1:

KEY-523898: It gave us a lift and knocked them off their feet at the same time; a real game-changing moment
STR-1:

KEY-523899: [%person#1-I] thought it was vital; they suffered a blow and weren't really able to recover from it
STR-1:

KEY-523900: Goals that late in the first half are always vital because the opposition can't immediately respond. It's much harder to recover from that sort of blow
STR-1:

KEY-523901: [%person#1-I] don't mind when the goals are scored, as long as we score them!
STR-1:

KEY-523902: [%person#1-I] don't think the timing mattered very much; we still had the rest of the match to play
STR-1:

KEY-523903: What did [%person#1-you] make of [%male#2]{s} bad day in front of goal?
STR-1:

KEY-523904: Do [%person#1-you] know why [%male#2] found it so hard to take his chances today?
STR-1:

KEY-523905: To miss those chances in the first place, you have to get into the positions, and [%person#1-I]'m happy with that. The goals will come
STR-1:

KEY-523906: That happens to the best players from time to time; as long as he's getting in position for the chances [%person#1-I]'ll be happy
STR-1:

KEY-523907: He maybe lacked a little composure and a little luck but [%person#1-I] can't fault the effort
STR-1:

KEY-523908: [%person#1-I]'m very happy with his effort and his application; the finishing can always be worked on
STR-1:

KEY-523909: It's a bad day for him, but he'll have plenty of good ones, and that's why we shouldn't focus too much on today's events
STR-1:

KEY-523910: He has to pick himself up and make amends next time. He knows that there can be no good without bad
STR-1:

KEY-523911: He knows the standards we set ourselves here and he'll be the most disappointed in that dressing room
STR-1:

KEY-523912: [%person#1-I] don't need to tell him that he needs to put those chances away. We'll work on improving in training as normal
STR-1:

KEY-523913: How surprised were [%person#1-you] to see [%male#2] on the scoresheet?
STR-1:

KEY-523914: We'll have a bit of a laugh about it because he doesn't have the best record in front of goal! Seriously though, well done to him, he deserved it
STR-1:

KEY-523915: He's done really well in trying to improve that area of his game and that hard work paid off here, [%person#1-I]'m happy for him
STR-1:

KEY-523916: [%person#1-I] keep telling him that he ought to score more often than he does, so hopefully this is the start of better luck for him in that regard
STR-1:

KEY-523917: Goals come and go but the consistency and quality of his performances matter most to me. That's the player he truly is
STR-1:

KEY-523918: Are [%person#1-you] happy even in defeat considering most pre-match predictions of a drubbing proved to be most inaccurate?
STR-1:

KEY-523919: [%team#2-short] were expected to lose heavily but the final scoreline was much closer. Does that give [%person#1-you] reason to be happy?
STR-1:

KEY-523920: [%person#1-I] think we can be happy with a lot of our performance and we showed what we're made of
STR-1:

KEY-523921: [%person#1-I] don't like to lose but [%person#1-I] think we've proved a lot of people wrong
STR-1:

KEY-523922: We gave it everything we have and showed that, if we do that, we're always in with a chance
STR-1:

KEY-523923: [%person#1-I]'m proud of our effort; we gave it 100% and we know what we can do when that happens
STR-1:

KEY-523924: [%person#1-I] think there was a better result there for us so [%person#1-I]'m a bit disappointed we didn't get that
STR-1:

KEY-523925: [%person#1-I] actually fancied us to get a result so, from that perspective, [%person#1-I]'m a little disappointed
STR-1:

KEY-523926: [%person#1-I] thought the game was there to be won and it's frustrating that we played within ourselves
STR-1:

KEY-523927: We lost, and [%person#1-I] don't think we should've lost. A frustrating day
STR-1:

KEY-523928: How impressed are [%person#2-you] at winning without allowing [%team#2-short] to have a single shot on target?
STR-1:

KEY-523929: Is it a reflection of [%person#2-your] dominance that [%team#2-short] didn't have so much as a single shot on target?
STR-1:

KEY-523930: [%person#1-I] think it was as complete a performance as we could've hoped for and [%person#1-I]'m very pleased
STR-1:

KEY-523931: That was what [%person#1-I]'d call a complete performance. It was very, very good
STR-1:

KEY-523932: That's the sort of defensive performance [%person#1-I] really enjoy. It's also the foundation for good, consistent results
STR-1:

KEY-523933: We were excellent defensively and, when we play like that, we're always going to have a really good chance of getting a result
STR-1:

KEY-523934: [%person#1-I] don't think we were dominant and there are certainly areas we can improve in
STR-1:

KEY-523935: Some people might think we were dominant but [%person#1-I] don't. [%person#1-I] wasn't happy with some of our play
STR-1:

KEY-523936: Those statistics flatter us somewhat, we weren't that dominant at all
STR-1:

KEY-523937: If there was ever a statistic that disguises the true nature of the match it's that one
STR-1:

KEY-523938: What did [%person#1-you] think about [%male#2]{s} late miss? That could've been the winner?
STR-1:

KEY-523939: Do [%person#1-you] regret [%male#2]{s} late miss that could have secured a win??
STR-1:

KEY-523940: It was frustrating, but that's football, it happens?
STR-1:

KEY-523941: Yeah [%person#1-I]'m disappointed, but there's no blame, it happens?
STR-1:

KEY-523942: It sort of summed up how the match went, though there are plenty of positives we can take away?
STR-1:

KEY-523943: We didn't get the luck we deserved but we can be happy with our performance?
STR-1:

KEY-523944: He know he should've scored it and he'll absolutely be working twice as hard to make up for it next time?
STR-1:

KEY-523945: He'll tell you he should've scored but [%person#1-I] won't hold it against him?
STR-1:

KEY-523946: [%person#1-I] was sure he was going to score and [%person#1-I] still can't believe he didn't?
STR-1:

KEY-523947: [%person#1-I]'m still at a loss for words, [%person#1-I] was already off celebrating!?
STR-1:

KEY-523948: What did [%person#1-you] make of the tactical battle out there?
STR-1:

KEY-523949: How do [%person#1-you] think the match went from a tactical perspective?
STR-1:

KEY-523950: [%person#1-I] found it fascinating and there's plenty [%person#1-I] can take away and learn from
STR-1:

KEY-523951: [%person#1-I] found it fascinating and intriguing and [%person#1-I]'m sure [%person#1-I]'m not alone in that
STR-1:

KEY-523952: It was the sort of match [%person#1-I] learned a lot from and [%person#1-I]'m pleased about that
STR-1:

KEY-523953: [%person#1-I] learned a lot about [%person#1-my] team and [%person#1-I]'ve definitely got plenty to think about now!
STR-1:

KEY-523954: [%person#1-I]'ll let everyone else talk about that, [%person#1-I] have to move on and focus on the future
STR-1:

KEY-523955: It's not for [%person#1-me] to talk about the tactics, [%person#1-I]'ll leave that to the pundits
STR-1:

KEY-523956: [%person#1-I] didn't think it provided very much of note to talk about, but the pseudo-analysts out there will probably write lengthy analysis about it, and good luck to them
STR-1:

KEY-523957: [%person#1-I] didn't think there was anything special about it, but that's just [%person#1-my] opinion
STR-1:

KEY-523958: With speculation rife about [%male#2]{s} future right now, what happens after he was left out today?
STR-1:

KEY-523959: [%person#1-You] left [%male#2] out today; can we read anything into his [%team#1-short] future as a result?
STR-1:

KEY-523960: He has a future here as long as he wants to be here
STR-1:

KEY-523961: [%person#1-I]'m not making any definitive statements now but [%person#1-I] certainly want him to remain a part of [%person#1-my] squad
STR-1:

KEY-523962: [%person#1-I] think it's up to him. If he wants to stay, he can make that very clear very easily
STR-1:

KEY-523963: [%person#1-I]'ve said all [%person#1-I]'m going to say; it's really all up to him what happens next
STR-1:

KEY-523964: [%person#1-I] have to plan for a future without him at the club. That might change but, for now, [%person#1-I] need to do right by the club
STR-1:

KEY-523965: [%person#1-My] priority is the team and, right now, he's not in the squad
STR-1:

KEY-523966: He doesn't want to be here, so why would [%person#1-I] pick him?
STR-1:

KEY-523967: [%person#1-I] think it's clear where he wants to be so we're going to get on with our jobs without him
STR-1:

KEY-523968: Good to beat [%person#1-your] rivals today, [%person#1-first]?
STR-1:

KEY-523969: [%person#1-You] must be pleased with a win over [%person#1-your] rivals?
STR-1:

KEY-523970: Yeah [%person#1-I]'m really pleased, especially for the fans, this means more to them
STR-1:

KEY-523971: [%person#1-I]'m delighted, it's a great win, and something for the fans to celebrate too
STR-1:

KEY-523972: A big win like that is always good for morale so [%person#1-I]'m happy
STR-1:

KEY-523973: [%person#1-I]'m pleased, it's the result we wanted, and it'll give us a lift for the future too
STR-1:

KEY-523974: It's always nice to win against a rival, but we can't dwell on it; we need to take the positives and work on the negatives
STR-1:

KEY-523975: A win is a win, we're happy, but we'll soon turn our focus to the next challenge
STR-1:

KEY-523976: We were lucky today, all things considered. That type of performance won't cut it for long
STR-1:

KEY-523977: [%person#1-I] don't think we were particularly good value for the win and we've got to cut out silly mistakes
STR-1:

KEY-523978: We've got a great group of players at the club and I'm confident we can beat anybody in this competition
STR-1:

KEY-523979: We'll just take it one game at a time. We're confident we've got as good a chance as anybody
STR-1:

KEY-523980: Wow! That match was certainly exciting to watch. What did [%person#1-you] make of it?
STR-1:

KEY-523981: The editors will have a hard time making a highlights package from that match. How does it feel to be involved in such a match?
STR-1:

KEY-523982: That game may go down as one of the competition's best. What did [%person#1-you] make of the game?
STR-1:

KEY-523983: [%person#1-I] absolutely loved that. It was one of the most entertaining matches [%person#1-I] can remember
STR-1:

KEY-523984: [%person#1-I] bet the fans had an absolutely brilliant day watching that. It was pure entertainment
STR-1:

KEY-523985: It was a match of extremely high quality and that showed in the goals scored
STR-1:

KEY-523986: It's always great for the fans to watch a game with so many highlights
STR-1:

KEY-523987: It was so good that even those that don't like us will be applauding that match
STR-1:

KEY-523988: [%person#1-I]'m sure it was entertaining to watch but we gave away too much space and time too easily
STR-1:

KEY-523989: We won't get far if we defend like that in the future so we need to tighten up a little
STR-1:

KEY-523990: We could have done a lot better in that match defensively and [%person#1-I]'ll be looking to rectify it
STR-1:

KEY-523991: We were very poor out there but we bailed ourselves out with our goals. We can't let that happen again
STR-1:

KEY-523992: [%person#1-I] was on edge for the whole time. It's the type of game fans love but managers hate
STR-1:

KEY-523993: It was a bit too unpredictable for [%person#1-my] liking, [%person#1-I] need us to assert more control over matches like these
STR-1:

KEY-523994: [%person#1-Your] must be satisfied with that sort of win against a bitter rival??
STR-1:

KEY-523995: How pleased are [%person#1-you] to beat [%person#1-your] bitter rivals??
STR-1:

KEY-523996: [%person#1-I]'m delighted; this sort of result definitely means that little bit more?
STR-1:

KEY-523997: [%person#1-I]'m very happy, we deserved to win, and it definitely means more to beat a rival?
STR-1:

KEY-523998: It means everything to everyone at this club and that's why [%person#1-I]'m happy?
STR-1:

KEY-523999: [%person#1-I]'m really happy for the fans in particular; they get the bragging rights now?
STR-1:

KEY-524000: A win's a win as far as [%person#1-I]'m concerned, they all count?
STR-1:

KEY-524001: [%person#1-I]'ll take a win against anyone, anywhere, any time?
STR-1:

KEY-524002: [%person#1-I] don't care that we beat a rival, [%person#1-I]'m only interested in the victory?
STR-1:

KEY-524003: The opponent doesn't matter, just the win for [%person#1-me]?
STR-1:

KEY-524004: How much does it hurt to lose to a fierce rival like that?
STR-1:

KEY-524005: How frustrated are [%person#1-you] to lose against a bitter rival?
STR-1:

KEY-524006: We deserved to win and that's what annoys [%person#1-me] most
STR-1:

KEY-524007: [%person#1-I] was pleased with the performance but the result wasn't what we wanted
STR-1:

KEY-524008: Okay, so the result didn't go to plan, but we can take solace from the many positives we showed out there
STR-1:

KEY-524009: There was a lot of good football on show despite the result and that's what we can build on
STR-1:

KEY-524010: [%person#1-I]'m sad for the fans, this will hurt them the most
STR-1:

KEY-524011: [%person#1-I]'m annoyed but [%person#1-I] can only imagine how our fans feel. We need to make amends
STR-1:

KEY-524012: [%person#1-I] hate losing, and [%person#1-I] really hate losing to our rivals. This isn't acceptable
STR-1:

KEY-524013: We weren't good enough and for that to happen against our rivals is a real sickener
STR-1:

KEY-524014: [%person#1-You] seem to have got one over [%person#2] with that result, how are [%person#1-you] feeling about your battle of wits?
STR-1:

KEY-524015: [%person#1-You] battled [%person#2] and got one over them, what impact has that had on [%person#1-you]?
STR-1:

KEY-524016: [%person#1-surname] doesn't believe in mind games
STR-1:

KEY-524017: [%person#1-I] was hoping my comments would have an effect on [%person#2-surname] and they did just that
STR-1:

KEY-524018: [%person#1-I]'ve never been that convinced by [%person#2] so [%person#1-I]'m delighted
STR-1:

KEY-524019: Hopefully now [%person#2] and everyone else watching us today will take us a little more seriously
STR-1:

KEY-524020: Opinions are hard to change and one moment rarely makes a difference
STR-1:

KEY-524021: [%person#1-I]'d like to think so but [%person#1-I] can't see things changing
STR-1:

KEY-524022: [%person#1-I]'ve never really believed in the supposed power of mind games. I think the press overstate their influence
STR-1:

KEY-524023: It's of no importance to [%person#1-me]. [%person#1-I] just want to win games
STR-1:

KEY-524024: [%person#1-You] struggled at times out there but managed to pull a win out of the bag despite being behind. What do [%person#1-you] make of that comeback?
STR-1:

KEY-524025: What did it take for [%person#1-you] to grab the victory from the jaws of defeat like that?
STR-1:

KEY-524026: [%person#1-I]'m so proud of everyone involved today. They never gave up, kept their belief and didn't stop working
STR-1:

KEY-524027: It shows just how determined a bunch we have here, [%person#1-I] couldn't be prouder
STR-1:

KEY-524028: [%person#1-I] wasn't too concerned; [%person#1-I] knew we had the qualities to change the match, we just needed patience
STR-1:

KEY-524029: [%person#1-I]'m happy, everyone worked for each other and managed to get the result we wanted
STR-1:

KEY-524030: [%person#1-My] heart was pumping but the lads pulled through in the end and [%person#1-I]'m very happy with how they responded
STR-1:

KEY-524031: We never should have allowed ourselves to be in that position so [%person#1-I]'m glad we were professional enough to rectify our mistakes
STR-1:

KEY-524032: On another day we may not have got the luck we needed to recover so we definitely need to make sure we don't fall behind like that again
STR-1:

KEY-524033: We simply cannot repeat what happened today, we won't always be able to bounce back in every match. We got away with it this time
STR-1:

KEY-524034: [%person#1-I] thought we played very badly. [%person#1-I]'m happy with the final result but we need to do some serious work to make sure this doesn't happen again
STR-1:

KEY-524035: Nice to get off to a winning start, [%person#1-first]?
STR-1:

KEY-524036: How pleased are [%person#1-you] to get off to a winning start?
STR-1:

KEY-524037: [%person#1-I] couldn't be happier, it was a great way to start
STR-1:

KEY-524038: [%person#1-I]'m delighted, what a great result!
STR-1:

KEY-524039: It's a promising start, but at the same time, it's just the first step in a long journey
STR-1:

KEY-524040: It's always pleasing to win, especially to kick things off
STR-1:

KEY-524041: To win is always good, but the performance wasn't as good as it could have been, and we need to keep improving
STR-1:

KEY-524042: [%person#1-I]'ll take the win but [%person#1-I] wasn't entirely happy with how we played
STR-1:

KEY-524043: We're happy to win but we probably didn't deserve to. We'll have to change that as soon as possible
STR-1:

KEY-524044: We weren't good enough so, although we won, there will have to be changes
STR-1:

KEY-524045: It took a while but [%person#1-you] got there eventually. [%person#1-You] must be a mix of pleased and relieved?
STR-1:

KEY-524046: Were [%person#1-you] nervous about how that match might have turned out before [%male#2]{s} goal?
STR-1:

KEY-524047: [%person#1-I] thought we were well on top and that goal was always coming. We deserved to win
STR-1:

KEY-524048: [%person#1-I] had faith that we would get there in the end, the goal was always coming
STR-1:

KEY-524049: [%person#1-I] think we made it harder than we needed to, but we got there eventually, and that's all that matters
STR-1:

KEY-524050: We arguably should have scored earlier, and we made it hard for ourselves, but all's well that ends well
STR-1:

KEY-524051: [%person#1-I]'ll be honest, [%person#1-I] couldn't see where a win was coming from, but then up stepped [%male#2-first] with a moment of quality
STR-1:

KEY-524052: That goal really saved us because [%person#1-I] couldn't see where a breakthrough was going to come from
STR-1:

KEY-524053: [%person#1-I] thought we were well out of sorts and pretty lucky. [%person#1-I]'ll take the win and run
STR-1:

KEY-524054: We weren't good enough today but [%person#1-I]'ll happily take the win in those circumstances
STR-1:

KEY-524055: [%person#1-Your] lineup today wasn't the strongest, so how do [%person#1-you] feel about the victory?
STR-1:

KEY-524056: That wasn't the usual lineup we've come to expect from [%person#1-you] but [%person#1-you] got the win anyway. What do [%person#1-you] make of that?
STR-1:

KEY-524057: [%person#1-I]'m very happy to have won, and to have seen our players put in such a professional performance
STR-1:

KEY-524058: [%person#1-I] am thrilled; some of the performances out there have given me some selection decisions to make in the future
STR-1:

KEY-524059: It's very encouraging to see and shows that everyone at the club is ready to contribute
STR-1:

KEY-524060: [%person#1-I] knew they could do it and was happy to see them prove me right
STR-1:

KEY-524061: [%person#1-I]'m happy but want to focus on our next challenge
STR-1:

KEY-524062: [%person#1-I] thought they did well but I expect that level from all our players
STR-1:

KEY-524063: [%person#1-I]'m not concerned by the details of who played, [%person#1-I]'m only concerned about the result
STR-1:

KEY-524064: It's the result of our culture here, it doesn't matter who we bring in to the squad, we're equipped enough to deal with anything
STR-1:

KEY-524065: [%person#1-You] must be delighted with such an emphatic win?
STR-1:

KEY-524066: What a performance and what a win! [%person#1-You] have to be pleased?
STR-1:

KEY-524067: [%person#1-I]'m absolutely delighted, we were terrific
STR-1:

KEY-524068: It was an exceptional performance and [%person#1-I] really couldn't be happier
STR-1:

KEY-524069: We played really well and [%person#1-I]'m pleased that we got the job done
STR-1:

KEY-524070: It's always pleasing when we go out and execute our game plan. [%person#1-I]'m very satisfied
STR-1:

KEY-524071: [%person#1-I]'m a perfectionist so [%person#1-I] think there were areas we could've been better in, but that's probably being harsh
STR-1:

KEY-524072: A very good result, yes, but the performance wasn't quite what [%person#1-I] was looking for. [%person#1-I] have high standards!
STR-1:

KEY-524073: [%person#1-I] don't know where that result came from, [%person#1-I] thought we played quite badly
STR-1:

KEY-524074: [%person#1-I] didn't think we played very well so [%person#1-I] have no idea how the final score ended up as it did
STR-1:

KEY-524075: [%person#1-You] must be delighted with that performance and subsequent victory?
STR-1:

KEY-524076: That win must please [%person#1-you]. How thrilled are [%person#1-you] with that win?
STR-1:

KEY-524077: How delighted are you with that triumph?
STR-1:

KEY-524078: [%person#1-first], you must be delighted with that result?
STR-1:

KEY-524079: They say proof is in the pudding and the pudding in this case is a football. We played some liquid football out there today and our opponents proved no match for us
STR-1:

KEY-524080: We executed the game plan to perfection. [%person#1-I]'m delighted with their performance
STR-1:

KEY-524081: [%person#1-I] can't wipe the smile off my face. [%person#1-I] love it when a plan comes together
STR-1:

KEY-524082: Our general play was very pleasing and [%person#1-I]'m elated to secure the win
STR-1:

KEY-524083: The players were applauded off by the fans. [%person#1-I] thought that spoke volumes about their efforts in securing the win
STR-1:

KEY-524084: [%person#1-I] saw patterns from the training ground on display throughout. The players have made [%person#1-me] very happy by gaining this result
STR-1:

KEY-524085: We've played better in the past but at least we got the win
STR-1:

KEY-524086: There are areas to improve from the performance [%person#1-I] just witnessed but fortunately those shortcomings didn't cost us today
STR-1:

KEY-524087: To win is the always the main objective but we made mistakes that could cost us in the future. Thankfully today that wasn't the case
STR-1:

KEY-524088: It was daylight robbery in truth. We can't expect to gain this level of luck every week
STR-1:

KEY-524089: A win is a win but this was a real smash and grab today. [%person#1-I]'m not happy with our performance in the slightest
STR-1:

KEY-524090: We'll take it but [%person#1-I]'ve told the dressing room exactly what [%person#1-I] thought of that performance. We were poor for large periods and the result has flattered us in the end
STR-1:

KEY-524091: Not the result [%person#1-you] wanted today then, [%person#1-first]?
STR-1:

KEY-524092: Obviously [%person#1-I]'m disappointed with the result but [%person#1-I] thought we played well enough to deserve more
STR-1:

KEY-524093: [%person#1-I] think there was some good and some bad, like most matches, and we'll have to work on improving the bad aspects if we're to avoid a repeat of that result
STR-1:

KEY-524094: We didn't really turn up, we didn't play to our strengths or do anything we'd planned for in training, and we deserved to lose
STR-1:

KEY-524095: We weren't good enough, [%person#1-I] haven't got much more to say than that. Unacceptable
STR-1:

KEY-524096: [%person#1-You]'re top of the league after that, happy?
STR-1:

KEY-524097: That result means [%team#1-short] are now top of the league, something which must make [%person#1-you] happy?
STR-1:

KEY-524098: It's nice to be top, we're pleased, and we're going to work hard to stay there
STR-1:

KEY-524099: Any time you go top of the league it's always pleasing; now we have to stay there
STR-1:

KEY-524100: It's a good position for us to be in right now and gives us reason to be optimistic
STR-1:

KEY-524101: We're happy and we're confident as we look forward to the future and try to build on this platform
STR-1:

KEY-524102: [%person#1-I]'m not really bothered where we are in the table right now, we'll take it game by game, and see where we end up
STR-1:

KEY-524103: [%person#1-I] don't think any of us are really looking at the league standings now. Let's see what the future brings
STR-1:

KEY-524104: The table will eventually take on a more familiar look but we'll enjoy these moments while we can
STR-1:

KEY-524105: We'll enjoy it while it lasts but [%person#1-I] don't think any of us are fooling ourselves into thinking this is where we're going to finish
STR-1:

KEY-524106: That result lifts [%team#1-short] right up the table, which can only be good for confidence, right?
STR-1:

KEY-524107: [%person#1-You] must be pleased with a result that sees [%team#1-short] shoot up the table?
STR-1:

KEY-524108: Everyone wants to be as high in the table as possible and we're doing well in that regard
STR-1:

KEY-524109: Yeah, it's always nice to be doing well, and long may it continue
STR-1:

KEY-524110: We can build from this and gather momentum to help us keep heading in the right direction. The mood is positive around the team at the moment
STR-1:

KEY-524111: [%person#1-I]'m happy, we're heading in the right direction, and hopefully we can continue to do that
STR-1:

KEY-524112: [%person#1-I]'ll let everyone else look at the table, [%person#1-my] focus is on making sure we're doing the right things on the pitch
STR-1:

KEY-524113: [%person#1-I] don't concern [%person#1-myself] with the league table, it's out of [%person#1-my] control, we just have to keep working hard to improve
STR-1:

KEY-524114: [%person#1-I] don't want to start yo-yoing up and down the table; consistency is key
STR-1:

KEY-524115: It's all about consistency. This means nothing if we don't build on it
STR-1:

KEY-524116: That was a really impressive victory! Some managers might look to give the team a rest from training after that, is that something [%person#1-you]'ll do?
STR-1:

KEY-524117: Are [%person#1-you] looking to give [%person#1-your] players a rest day after such an impressive performance?
STR-1:

KEY-524118: For sure, it was a superb performance all-round
STR-1:

KEY-524119: They deserve one after that and [%person#1-I]'m definitely not going to deny them
STR-1:

KEY-524120: [%person#1-I] think that's a reasonable idea
STR-1:

KEY-524121: [%person#1-I] believe achievements should be rewarded appropriately
STR-1:

KEY-524122: Possibly, we'll have to look at what work we need to do and how that might fit in
STR-1:

KEY-524123: It's not always as simple as that but they all know how appreciative [%person#1-I] am of that performance
STR-1:

KEY-524124: Unfortunately [%person#1-I] don't think that would be the best decision at the moment
STR-1:

KEY-524125: Just because we played well doesn't mean we should start resting on our laurels. [%person#1-I] believe [%person#1-you] can't achieve anything without working hard
STR-1:

KEY-524126: Has that result prompted any considerations to altering [%person#1-your] approach?
STR-1:

KEY-524127: [%person#1-I]'m not happy with that so [%person#1-I] expect to see them all working hard to make sure that doesn't happen again
STR-1:

KEY-524128: [%person#1-I] don't think we need major changes, football's a game of fine margins and with a couple of tweaks [%person#1-I]'m confident we can improve
STR-1:

KEY-524129: Results like this can prompt self-doubt but we have to remain firm and believe in our project
STR-1:

KEY-524130: It would be foolish to change our plans based on one result. [%person#1-I]'m confident we're on the right track
STR-1:

KEY-524131: Congratulations [%person#1-first], what does it mean to win the [%comp#1-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-524132: Congratulations [%person#1-first]; tell us what winning the [%comp#1-short] means to [%person#1-you]?
STR-1:

KEY-524133: [%person#1-I]'m very happy, everyone's worked hard for this, and they've been rewarded
STR-1:

KEY-524134: It's always very nice to win trophies and [%person#1-I]'m really pleased for everyone involved in this success
STR-1:

KEY-524135: [%person#1-I]'m very proud; it's so nice to step back and watch everyone celebrate. They've earned it
STR-1:

KEY-524136: [%person#1-I] think proud is the word that comes to mind; we've worked hard to get to this position and we deserved to win
STR-1:

KEY-524137: [%person#1-I]'m most happy for our fans; they cherish these moments more than anyone else
STR-1:

KEY-524138: [%person#1-I] want to dedicate this to our fans; they're the ones we do this for
STR-1:

KEY-524139: We've been the best team in the competition and we deserve this
STR-1:

KEY-524140: We deserve to be the winners, it's that simple. We've been the best team
STR-1:

KEY-524141: A massive result today; how did [%person#1-you] do it?
STR-1:

KEY-524142: That's a huge result for [%team#1-short]. Tell us, how did [%person#1-you] do it?
STR-1:

KEY-524143: [%person#1-surname] credits players for [%team#2-short] win
STR-1:

KEY-524144: [%person#1-surname]: We believed in ourselves
STR-1:

KEY-524145: [%person#1-surname] admits 'a little luck' helped towards win
STR-1:

KEY-524146: [%person#1-surname] discusses win against [%team#2-short]
STR-1:

KEY-524147: [%person#1-I] don't know how we won but [%person#1-I]'m very happy we did!
STR-1:

KEY-524148: It's all down to the players. They worked hard, stuck to the game plan, and got the rewards they deserved
STR-1:

KEY-524149: The players produced big moments when they mattered most and, when you can do that, you always have a chance
STR-1:

KEY-524150: We always believed in ourselves. There's no point in even trying if you don't have that confidence and we certainly do
STR-1:

KEY-524151: Others might write us off but we always believe in ourselves, and that spirit and togetherness got us through today
STR-1:

KEY-524152: Okay, maybe we had a little bit of luck, but [%person#1-I]'d argue we deserved it for the way we approached the match
STR-1:

KEY-524153: We gave it everything we had and we got the little bit of luck we probably deserved at the end of it all
STR-1:

KEY-524154: That's football at the end of the day. People might not have expected us to win but we proved them wrong
STR-1:

KEY-524155: It's not about how we won today, it's about how we approach our work, and that's the most satisfying thing reflecting on this result
STR-1:

KEY-524156: [%person#1-You] never looked entirely comfortable but is it fair to say [%person#1-you] were relatively confident?
STR-1:

KEY-524157: Were [%person#1-you] always confident despite moments where it looked far from comfortable?
STR-1:

KEY-524158: [%person#1-surname] believed [%team#1-short] would win
STR-1:

KEY-524159: [%person#1-surname] backs [%team#1-short] to succeed
STR-1:

KEY-524160: [%person#1-surname]: We weren't that comfortable
STR-1:

KEY-524161: [%person#1-surname] admits to being surprised after big win
STR-1:

KEY-524162: What [%person#1-I] feel isn't really important. It's the players who matter most
STR-1:

KEY-524163: You can look at the patterns of play and the flow of the contest and see where it's going; [%person#1-I] always felt we were in with a chance here
STR-1:

KEY-524164: The way the game was going, the momentum always seemed to just about favour us, and [%person#1-I] thought we'd be able to get a result
STR-1:

KEY-524165: There's always an element of luck involved but it didn't seem like the sort of game we'd lose
STR-1:

KEY-524166: [%person#1-I] thought we did well; you can talk about luck here and there but [%person#1-I] was fairly confident we'd get something, yes
STR-1:

KEY-524167: [%person#1-I]'ll be the first to admit that we weren't comfortable, but we did get over the line
STR-1:

KEY-524168: You're never 100% comfortable at this level and [%person#1-I] certainly wasn't going to celebrate before the final whistle!
STR-1:

KEY-524169: To be perfectly honest [%person#1-I]'m a bit surprised, not because [%person#1-I] doubt [%person#1-my] players, but because of the way we won
STR-1:

KEY-524170: [%person#1-I]'d be lying if [%person#1-I] said [%person#1-I] expected us to win in the way we did, put it that way
STR-1:

KEY-524171: Did [%person#1-you] honestly believe [%person#1-you] could take advantage of their poor form?
STR-1:

KEY-524172: Did [%team#2-short]{s} poor recent form give [%person#1-you] the belief [%person#1-you] could win?
STR-1:

KEY-524173: [%person#1-surname] capitalised on [%team#2-short]{s} form
STR-1:

KEY-524174: [%person#1-surname]: We backed ourselves against [%team#2-short]
STR-1:

KEY-524175: [%person#1-surname] respected [%team#2-short] despite poor form
STR-1:

KEY-524176: [%person#1-surname]: Believing is one thing, winning is another
STR-1:

KEY-524177: Ask [%person#1-me] about that next time; [%person#1-I]'m still processing the result!
STR-1:

KEY-524178: We never lack belief; when we get into games like this, we recognise we're able to compete, and then it's about whether we can go on and find a way to win
STR-1:

KEY-524179: We know what we're capable of and we believe in our ability. Once we're competing, it's then a case of 'can you go and win it?'
STR-1:

KEY-524180: We'll back ourselves against anyone and, if the opposition are struggling, we have to go after the win with everything we've got
STR-1:

KEY-524181: It certainly helps our chances if they're struggling but we still have to do our part, and [%person#1-my] players always believe in themselves
STR-1:

KEY-524182: [%person#1-I] respect [%team#2-short] as much as anyone and didn't think their form meant much ahead of kickoff. This was a tough match and a big win
STR-1:

KEY-524183: Form is temporary, class is permanent. We knew this would be a tough match and so it proved, but we deserved to win
STR-1:

KEY-524184: We always believe, but it's about so much more than that. [%person#1-I] think we're all a little surprised at how this one unfolded
STR-1:

KEY-524185: Did we think we could win? Yes. Did we expect to win? Absolutely not, but that's football, and it's very pleasing that we did
STR-1:

KEY-524186: How big is this result given the wider context?
STR-1:

KEY-524187: Taking everything into account, how big a result is this?
STR-1:

KEY-524188: [%person#1-surname] hails 'huge result'
STR-1:

KEY-524189: [%person#1-surname]: Winning breeds confidence
STR-1:

KEY-524190: [%person#1-surname] doesn't want to become complacent after [%team#2-short] triumph
STR-1:

KEY-524191: [%person#1-surname] focused on the future after beating [%team#2-short]
STR-1:

KEY-524192: Everyone will have a different perspective on what the result means, [%person#1-my] opinion isn't relevant
STR-1:

KEY-524193: It's a huge result. We played the match as it needed to be played, in our style, and it showed everyone what we're capable of
STR-1:

KEY-524194: You know what, it's a really huge result, because we did all the things we have to do in order to win, and got our rewards
STR-1:

KEY-524195: Winning breeds confidence, it's as simple as that, and big wins mean we grow in confidence and belief
STR-1:

KEY-524196: We're all in this game to win, let's not pretend otherwise, so moments like this are what it's all about
STR-1:

KEY-524197: It's a good win, a big win, but we can't afford to grow complacent because of it
STR-1:

KEY-524198: [%person#1-I]'m delighted with the result but we can't afford to dwell on it
STR-1:

KEY-524199: We'll celebrate this win until tomorrow, then we'll focus on the future. That's always been how we've worked
STR-1:

KEY-524200: It's a win, no better or worse than any other win. What we do next will be much more important
STR-1:

KEY-524201: A disappointing result; in [%person#1-your] view, what happened today?
STR-1:

KEY-524202: Tell us [%person#1-first], what happened out there today?
STR-1:

KEY-524203: [%person#1-surname] pleased despite defeat
STR-1:

KEY-524204: [%person#1-surname] sees positives in defeat
STR-1:

KEY-524205: [%person#1-surname] frustrated in defeat
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-524207: [%person#1-I] don't know, [%person#1-I] need to watch the match back again with a clearer perspective
STR-1:

KEY-524208: [%person#1-I] thought we played well enough to win, but you can't always win, and today was one of those days
STR-1:

KEY-524209: We did enough to deserve a victory, but when it's not your day, it's not your day
STR-1:

KEY-524210: First of all, congratulations to [%team#2-short], but [%person#1-I]'m happy enough. There are lots of positives to take away
STR-1:

KEY-524211: [%person#1-I] don't like the result but [%person#1-I] did like a lot of what we did out there. We'll be fine most of the time playing like that
STR-1:

KEY-524212: Of course [%person#1-I]'m frustrated, [%person#1-I] don't want to lose, but we didn't deserve to win today
STR-1:

KEY-524213: We didn't do all of the things we're meant to do to play our football and, when that happens, it's hard to win
STR-1:

KEY-524214: It's [%person#1-my] job to give the players the right amount of confidence to win and [%person#1-I] didn't do that today
STR-1:

KEY-524215: We weren't prepared to play today and that's [%person#1-my] fault
STR-1:

KEY-524216: Why do [%person#1-you] think it's [%person#1-your] fault?
STR-1:

KEY-524217: Why do [%person#1-you] feel the blame lies with [%person#1-you]?
STR-1:

KEY-524218: [%person#1-surname] shoulders blame for defeat

KEY-524219: [%person#1-surname]: [%person#1-I] have to do better as manager
STR-1:

KEY-524220: [%person#1-surname] striving to improve
STR-1:

KEY-524221: [%person#1-surname] casts doubt on future
STR-1:

KEY-524222: [%person#1-I] should think it's pretty obvious
STR-1:

KEY-524223: [%person#1-I]'m the manager, it's always [%person#1-my] fault if we don't win
STR-1:

KEY-524224: It's [%person#1-my] job to make sure we're doing everything we can to win so it follows that [%person#1-I]'m at fault if we don't
STR-1:

KEY-524225: [%person#1-I] have to do better as the manager of this team. We didn't reach our levels today
STR-1:

KEY-524226: [%person#1-I]'m responsible for preparing the players and making changes during the matches and everything else. [%person#1-I] have to be better at [%person#1-my] job
STR-1:

KEY-524227: [%person#1-I]'m not saying [%person#1-I]'m perfect, nobody is, but results like this make it clear that [%person#1-I] have to improve
STR-1:

KEY-524228: [%person#1-I]'m always looking to improve but there's nothing like a defeat to make [%person#1-me] realise how far [%person#1-I] have to go
STR-1:

KEY-524229: [%person#1-I]'ve made mistakes that have cost us points and [%person#1-I] can't afford to do that, otherwise [%person#1-I]'ll soon be unemployed
STR-1:

KEY-524230: If [%person#1-I]'m not doing [%person#1-my] job, the team suffers, and you can work the rest out yourself
STR-1:

KEY-524231: Would it be fair to say the players are lacking belief right now?
STR-1:

KEY-524232: So if the players aren't carrying out instructions do [%person#1-you] think they're lacking belief?
STR-1:

KEY-524233: [%person#1-surname]: [%person#1-My] players believe
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-524235: [%person#1-surname] admits players are struggling
STR-1:

KEY-524236: [%person#1-surname]: We're low on confidence
STR-1:

KEY-524237: Even if [%person#1-I] did, [%person#1-I] wouldn't discuss it in public
STR-1:

KEY-524238: [%person#1-I] don't think we're lacking in belief, [%person#1-I] think we're lacking in execution
STR-1:

KEY-524239: [%person#1-I] will never doubt just how much [%person#1-my] players believe in themselves and each other. That's not the problem
STR-1:

KEY-524240: [%person#1-I] wouldn't say there's a lack of belief; [%person#1-I]'m confident in their mentality, but we're not playing well
STR-1:

KEY-524241: It's not like they're not trying; if one or two things go in their favour then that changes everything
STR-1:

KEY-524242: Maybe, [%person#1-I] couldn't say for sure right now. We don't look ourselves though
STR-1:

KEY-524243: [%person#1-I] don't want to say that we're lacking belief but we are certainly struggling
STR-1:

KEY-524244: We're low on confidence and, when that happens, we've got real problems
STR-1:

KEY-524245: [%person#1-I] think it's clear that we're low on confidence and have to do something to change that
STR-1:

KEY-524246: Why are [%person#1-your] players struggling in front of goal?
STR-1:

KEY-524247: Why do [%person#1-you] think [%person#1-your] team have found life so hard in front of goal recently?

STR-1:

KEY-524253: Our underlying numbers show we're doing well actually. [%person#1-I]'m confident that it'll all work out just fine
STR-1:

KEY-524254: [%person#1-I]'m not worried because our advanced numbers show that we're doing a good job, and we're just going through a bad moment
STR-1:

KEY-524255: We need a little bit of luck. We're doing all the right things, we're creating good chances, they just need to go in
STR-1:

KEY-524256: It all comes back to luck. [%person#1-I] know we're doing well but not getting that little bit of extra help that changes the conversation
STR-1:

KEY-524257: The difference between a good footballer and a very good footballer is decision-making. We don't have that quality in the team at the moment
STR-1:

KEY-524258: [%person#1-I] think we need to show more quality and personality in possession. We're predictable and easy to defend
STR-1:

KEY-524259: [%person#1-I] have to admit [%person#1-I]'m worried about our attacking form, we're not doing anything we set out to do
STR-1:

KEY-524260: We don't look like we know what we're doing when we get into attacking areas and that does worry [%person#1-me]
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-524267: A win's a win in [%person#1-my] book, it doesn't matter where, when or how
STR-1:

KEY-524268: We had a game plan, we stuck to it, and [%person#1-I] couldn't be prouder of every single one of [%person#1-my] players
STR-1:

KEY-524269: That's why we're in this business, right? Moments like that make it all worthwhile, [%person#1-I]'m so proud
STR-1:

KEY-524270: We're all really pleased with the result but also the performance. That was something we worked really hard for
STR-1:

KEY-524271: [%person#1-I]'m very pleased, we played our game, took our chances, and deserved to win
STR-1:

KEY-524272: It's a nice moment; maybe we were a little bit lucky, but [%person#1-I] think you make your own luck
STR-1:

KEY-524273: People will say we got lucky, and perhaps we did, but [%person#1-I]'ll take that all day long
STR-1:

KEY-524274: It's a funny one because the result is really impressive but [%person#1-I] don't think we played very well at all
STR-1:

KEY-524275: [%person#1-I]'m actually a little conflicted because [%person#1-I] don't think we deserved to win, but [%person#1-I] will take it
STR-1:

KEY-524276: [%person#1-You]'ve been on a good run lately but that was something else!
STR-1:

KEY-524277: That was a really impressive performance even considering [%person#1-your] recent form, right?
STR-1:

KEY-524278: [%person#1-surname]: We deserved it
STR-1:

KEY-524279: [%person#1-surname] says [%team#1-short] are playing well
STR-1:

KEY-524280: 'One game at a time', says [%person#1-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-524281: [%person#1-surname] keen to stay level-headed
STR-1:

KEY-524282: That's for you lot to decide, [%person#1-I]'ll just focus on [%person#1-my] team
STR-1:

KEY-524283: Everyone's playing well, giving 100%, and we deserved to win this match
STR-1:

KEY-524284: When [%person#1-you] have everyone doing what's asked of them, helping each other out and doing the dirty work, it's easy. We deserve this
STR-1:

KEY-524285: We're playing well, long may it continue
STR-1:

KEY-524286: [%person#1-I]'m happy with the way we're playing and more results like this will be very welcome
STR-1:

KEY-524287: [%person#1-My] job is to make sure we take things one game at a time and try to build a strong platform for this team
STR-1:

KEY-524288: We are doing well right now but it'll be for nothing if we don't stay focused on taking things a match at a time
STR-1:

KEY-524289: It's more important now for us to stay level-headed and not think we're better than we are
STR-1:

KEY-524290: For as well as we're doing, it could all go wrong if we think we're better than we are, so we have to be guarded against complacency
STR-1:

KEY-524291: Can we talk about [%male#2]{s} goal for a moment please?

STR-1:

KEY-524296: [%person#1-surname] sets challenge for [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-524297: [%person#1-I]'ll let everyone else argue about the merits of the goal; [%person#1-I]'m just happy he scored!
STR-1:

KEY-524298: It was a great strike from a player who really deserved it
STR-1:

KEY-524299: He's pulled off a massive moment for this team and showed his quality

STR-1:

KEY-524303: He's a quality player and has that in his locker. [%person#1-I]'d like to see more of it!
STR-1:

KEY-524304: He knows what [%person#1-I] want from him and showed what he's capable of today. Now, he has to do it even more often
STR-1:

KEY-524305: [%person#1-I] think he's a great player with a lot more to offer; goals like that need to become a regular part of his game
STR-1:

KEY-524306: Can we talk about [%male#2]{s} terrific solo goal for a moment please?

STR-1:

KEY-524311: It was one of those goals that lives long in the memory because it was so exciting to watch unfold. What a great goal
STR-1:

KEY-524312: It was an incredible goal; solo goals like that are always crowd-pleasers because there's the excitement builds the closer he gets to the goal
STR-1:

KEY-524313: [%person#1-I] thought it was a great goal and great moment from a player who can light up matches like that
STR-1:

KEY-524314: It was a great goal but it also came at a really important time for us
STR-1:

KEY-524315: He's got so much individual skill and you can see it in moments like that! More please!
STR-1:

KEY-524316: We know he's capable of that, his skill level is incredible, and if he can score a few more [%person#1-I]'ll be happy!
STR-1:

KEY-524317: [%person#1-I] know he's got that in his game and [%person#1-I]'ve challenged him to make things like that happen more often
STR-1:

KEY-524318: He knows as well as [%person#1-I] do that the real challenge is to able to produce those moments over and over again
STR-1:

KEY-524319: Can we talk about [%male#2]{s} absolute blockbuster of a goal for a moment please?
STR-1:

KEY-524320: What a great goal [%male#2] scored today! A truly superb long-range effort!

STR-1:

KEY-524322: [%person#1-surname] pleased with [%male#2-surname]{s} long-range goal
STR-1:

KEY-524323: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] can score from anywhere
STR-1:

KEY-524324: It was one of those moments that gets [%person#1-you] out of [%person#1-your] seat in amazement, what a goal
STR-1:

KEY-524325: When [%person#1-I] saw him lining it up [%person#1-I] thought 'here we go', what a fantastic strike
STR-1:

KEY-524326: It was such a clean strike, a moment of real beauty, and one we sorely needed
STR-1:

KEY-524327: It's a quality goal from a quality player, [%person#1-I]'m very happy
STR-1:

KEY-524328: He sometimes thinks he can score from anywhere and, to be fair to him, he probably can!
STR-1:

KEY-524329: Not many players would take that shot on but, then again, not many players are capable of scoring goals like that
STR-1:

KEY-524330: He's got such a good shot on him that [%person#1-I]'ve told him he has to make more of that
STR-1:

KEY-524331: [%person#1-I] know he has that in his bag and [%person#1-I]'ve been encouraging him to try it a bit more often
STR-1:

KEY-524332: A lovely headed goal from [%male#2] today, would [%person#1-you] say?
STR-1:

KEY-524333: A word for [%male#2]{s} headed goal?
STR-1:

KEY-524334: [%person#1-surname] lauds [%male#2-surname]{s} header
STR-1:

KEY-524335: [%person#1-surname] pleased with [%male#2-surname]{s} header
STR-1:

KEY-524336: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] is a threat in the air
STR-1:

KEY-524337: It was a really well-taken goal, he's obviously good in that department, and it was a great moment for us
STR-1:

KEY-524338: He's very astute in the air, times his moments well, and that was a really well-taken goal
STR-1:

KEY-524339: [%person#1-I] was pleased with that, yeah, he showed just how skilled a header of a ball he is
STR-1:

KEY-524340: He took it well, got everything right, and [%person#1-I] was pleased to see it
STR-1:

KEY-524341: He's such a threat from aerial situations so it doesn't surprise [%person#1-me] in the slightest
STR-1:

KEY-524342: [%person#1-I] know how good he is in the air and at timing his headers. For such a strength, [%person#1-I]'d love to see him score more of them
STR-1:

KEY-524343: [%person#1-I]'ve spoken to him about this before but [%person#1-I]'d really love to see him scoring headers each and every match. He's capable of it
STR-1:

KEY-524344: He's got the ability to score those sorts of goals more frequently and [%person#1-I]'d really like to see that happen
STR-1:

KEY-524345: What did [%person#1-you] make of [%male#2] scoring with his weaker foot?
STR-1:

KEY-524346: That was a great goal from [%male#2] on his weaker foot, right?
STR-1:

KEY-524347: [%person#1-surname] enjoyed [%male#2-surname]{s} goal
STR-1:

KEY-524348: [%person#1-surname] pleased with [%male#2-surname]{s} goal
STR-1:

KEY-524349: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] should trust himself more
STR-1:

KEY-524350: [%person#1-surname] surprised by [%male#2-surname]{s} goal
STR-1:

KEY-524351: They all count! That's all [%person#1-I]'ll say about it
STR-1:

KEY-524352: [%person#1-I] really enjoyed it! If you didn't know any better you'd say it was his stronger foot
STR-1:

KEY-524353: To produce that sort of finish on your so-called weaker side takes some doing. All credit to him
STR-1:

KEY-524354: [%person#1-I] was really pleased for him because it's something he works hard at. There's your reward
STR-1:

KEY-524355: That strike is testament to hard work and dedication. He works on every area of his game and he's shown what a good player he is
STR-1:

KEY-524356: [%person#1-I] wish he'd trust himself on that side a bit more! He's clearly capable
STR-1:

KEY-524357: He should back himself in those situations more often. He's good enough to carry a threat, as we've clearly seen
STR-1:

KEY-524358: [%person#1-I] had to do a double-take to make sure [%person#1-I] saw what [%person#1-I] thought [%person#1-I] saw!
STR-1:

KEY-524359: [%person#1-I] was as surprised as anyone! Fair play to him though!
STR-1:

KEY-524360: What do [%person#1-you] make of [%male#2] out-performing his expected goals right now?
STR-1:

KEY-524361: [%male#2] is out-performing his xG right now; do [%person#1-you] have an opinion about that?
STR-1:

KEY-524362: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] the exception to the rule
STR-1:

KEY-524363: [%male#2-surname] is a 'quality finisher', says [%person#1-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-524364: [%person#1-surname] expects [%male#2-surname]{s} finishing to regress
STR-1:

KEY-524365: [%person#1-surname] fears drop in [%male#2-surname]{s} scoring
STR-1:

KEY-524366: [%person#1-I]'ll leave that to the analysts and pundits
STR-1:

KEY-524367: He's an exception as far as [%person#1-I]'m concerned; [%person#1-I] understand xG and all of that but some players are able to finish to a consistently high level
STR-1:

KEY-524368: Outliers exist for a reason and [%person#1-I] know his quality. He'll continue to score goals for us at a very respectable rate
STR-1:

KEY-524369: He's a quality finisher, whether the stats back that up or not, and [%person#1-I]'m confident he'll carry on showing that
STR-1:

KEY-524370: [%person#1-I] know his quality in front of goal, he's a top finisher, and the stats will eventually vindicate that
STR-1:

KEY-524371: [%person#1-I]'m sure his numbers will eventually regress to the mean but that doesn't have to be a bad thing. He's excellent
STR-1:

KEY-524372: Whether his goals eventually regress or not, and they might, [%person#1-I]'m very happy with what he's doing
STR-1:

KEY-524373: It's inevitable that the numbers will eventually balance themselves out and we'll have to be ready for that
STR-1:

KEY-524374: The stats don't lie; we need to make sure we're able, as a team, to handle any drop in goalscoring without losing ground in the table
STR-1:

KEY-524375: [%male#2]{s} goal was a bit of a collector's item, wasn't it? It was surely a fluke?
STR-1:

KEY-524376: What did [%person#1-you] make of [%male#2]{s} fluke goal?
STR-1:

KEY-524377: [%person#1-surname] claims [%male#2-surname] meant 'fluke' goal
STR-1:

KEY-524378: [%person#1-surname] enjoyed [%male#2-surname]{s} fluke
STR-1:

KEY-524379: [%person#1-surname]: We deserved good luck
STR-1:

KEY-524380: [%person#1-surname] feels for [%team#2-short] after fluke goal
STR-1:

KEY-524381: A goal's a goal as far as [%person#1-I]'m concerned
STR-1:

KEY-524382: It wouldn't surprise [%person#1-me] if he meant it! He's always trying weird things, sometimes they come off
STR-1:

KEY-524383: He'll probably claim he meant it! [%person#1-I] wouldn't be surprised either, he's perfectly capable
STR-1:

KEY-524384: [%person#1-I] had a laugh, but [%person#1-I] also celebrated it, because it was a great moment for all of us
STR-1:

KEY-524385: Whatever it was, [%person#1-I] certainly enjoyed it! Fair play to him
STR-1:

KEY-524386: They all count and [%person#1-I] think we deserved the luck at that stage
STR-1:

KEY-524387: It doesn't say fluke on the score sheet so [%person#1-I] don't care! We were due some luck too
STR-1:

KEY-524388: If that happened against us [%person#1-I] know [%person#1-I]'d be a bit annoyed so [%person#1-I] have to feel for [%team#2-short]
STR-1:

KEY-524389: [%team#2-short] have [%person#1-my] sympathies because [%person#1-I]'d be fuming if something like that happened against us
STR-1:

KEY-524390: [%male#2] certainly benefitted from a pretty big deflection for that goal, didn't he?
STR-1:

KEY-524391: A deflected goal from [%male#2] seemed to give [%person#1-you] a much-needed stroke of luck?

STR-1:

KEY-524393: 'We deserved some luck', says [%person#1-surname]

STR-1:

KEY-524395: [%person#1-surname] shows sympathy after deflected goal
STR-1:

KEY-524396: [%person#1-I] don't think it was that big of a deflection; [%male#2-first] deserves a lot of credit
STR-1:

KEY-524397: Don't take anything away from [%male#2-first], he deserves praise for the goal as much as anything else
STR-1:

KEY-524398: Well [%person#1-I] think we deserved some luck, so we'll take it
STR-1:

KEY-524399: These things happen in football and [%person#1-I] think we deserved that luck, yeah
STR-1:

KEY-524400: Sometimes deflections hurt you, sometimes they help you. Today, it was our day
STR-1:

KEY-524401: You can't predict when luck will turn your way but you have to take a chance in the first place. [%male#2-first] did that
STR-1:

KEY-524402: Morale seems really high right now; how far can it take [%person#1-you]?
STR-1:

KEY-524403: There seems to be a real buzz around the team at the minute. How far can that take [%person#1-you]?

STR-1:

KEY-524407: [%person#1-surname]: Confidence is always fragile
STR-1:

KEY-524408: [%person#1-I]'m not going to talk about it for fear of jinxing things
STR-1:

KEY-524409: Management is easy when things are going well. It's a joy to work here right now and long may that continue
STR-1:

KEY-524410: Football is really simple; if the players are happy, the results come much easier. [%person#1-I] hope it stays that way
STR-1:

KEY-524411: This is the sort of thing we need to build on and take advantage of. If we can cultivate a strong team spirit we'll be onto something special
STR-1:

KEY-524412: If we can build on these good times [%person#1-I]'ll be very happy. Good morale is so important
STR-1:

KEY-524413: The dynamics of a football changing room aren't easy to manage so, when things are going well, [%person#1-I] want to make it count
STR-1:

KEY-524414: Confidence and morale can go up and down like a yo-yo; the dynamics are really hard to manage, so [%person#1-I] can only hope this lasts a while longer
STR-1:

KEY-524415: Confidence is the most fragile aspect of football and [%person#1-I]'m not going to get complacent about this lasting
STR-1:

KEY-524416: Look, confidence is fragile at the best of times, so we'll enjoy the good times as much as we can and see how far it takes us
STR-1:

KEY-524417: Morale seems really low right now; how can [%person#1-you] turn things around?

KEY-524421: [%person#1-surname]: Hard work ahead
STR-1:

KEY-524422: [%person#1-surname] expects tough road ahead for [%team#1-short]
STR-1:

KEY-524423: We'll work on that and see how it goes
STR-1:

KEY-524424: If football has taught [%person#1-me] anything, it's that everything can change. We'll find happier times before long
STR-1:

KEY-524425: [%person#1-I]'m an optimist, so of course [%person#1-I]'m confident that we can come together as a team and find a way through these times
STR-1:

KEY-524426: We're made of stern stuff so we'll persevere and know that we can and will turn this around
STR-1:

KEY-524427: None of us enjoy the situation we find ourselves in so [%person#1-I] choose to believe we will find a way to lift morale soon
STR-1:

KEY-524428: It's going to take a lot of hard work, and it might not happen immediately, but we have to try
STR-1:

KEY-524429: There's no substitute for hard work. We know how good things can be, so it's up to us to turn things around
STR-1:

KEY-524430: There's a long and tough road ahead, make no mistake about it. [%person#1-I] think we've got plenty of work to do
STR-1:

KEY-524431: It's hard to see the light in the darkness at times and we've got a long and tough road ahead before we can lift the mood around here
STR-1:

KEY-524432: Can we have a quick update on [%male#2]{s} injury?
STR-1:

KEY-524433: Do [%person#1-you] have any news on [%male#2]{s} injury?

STR-1:

KEY-524436: [%person#1-surname] unsure about [%male#2-surname] injury
STR-1:

KEY-524437: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] injury could be serious
STR-1:

KEY-524438: [%person#1-I] haven't spoken to the medical staff yet so we'll have to wait and see
STR-1:

KEY-524439: We'll need to do further tests but the hope is that it isn't too serious
STR-1:

KEY-524440: From what [%person#1-I]'ve heard, [%person#1-I] think we might have escaped without a serious problem
STR-1:

KEY-524441: We're hopeful; we have to run some tests but fingers crossed he'll be okay
STR-1:

KEY-524442: [%person#1-I] don't have all the information but [%person#1-I]'m hopeful he'll be alright
STR-1:

KEY-524443: Honestly, [%person#1-I] don't know. We need to see where things are in a few hours and go from there
STR-1:

KEY-524444: We need to see how things go, [%person#1-I] really don't know right now, it could be anything
STR-1:

KEY-524445: [%person#1-I] hope [%person#1-I]'m wrong but it didn't look good from where [%person#1-I] was sitting
STR-1:

KEY-524446: It didn't look good, [%person#1-I] hope it isn't serious, but we'll have to wait and see
STR-1:

KEY-524447: Can we have a quick injury update?
STR-1:

KEY-524448: Do [%person#1-you] have any news on the injuries [%person#1-your] team suffered?
STR-1:

KEY-524449: [%person#1-surname] confident about injuries
STR-1:

KEY-524450: [%person#1-surname] hopeful on injury front
STR-1:

KEY-524451: [%person#1-surname] unsure about injuries
STR-1:

KEY-524452: [%person#1-surname] fears impact of injuries
STR-1:

KEY-524453: We'll need to do further tests but the hope is that nothing serious has happened
STR-1:

KEY-524454: From what [%person#1-I]'ve heard, [%person#1-I] think we might have escaped without serious problems
STR-1:

KEY-524455: We're hopeful; we have to run some tests but fingers crossed they'll be okay
STR-1:

KEY-524456: [%person#1-I] don't have all the information but [%person#1-I]'m hopeful they'll be alright
STR-1:

KEY-524457: [%person#1-I] hope [%person#1-I]'m wrong but we might have some issues
STR-1:

KEY-524458: [%person#1-I] hope for nothing serious, but we'll have to wait and see [%person#1-I]'m afraid
STR-1:

KEY-524459: Is there a risk of [%person#1-your] players struggling to cope with the pressure that this sort of match brings?
STR-1:

KEY-524460: We're not the sort of team that will wilt under the first sign of pressure. It gives us confidence and we'll be going in fired up
STR-1:

KEY-524461: [%person#1-I]'m not concerned, the mood is positive in our camp, and we're ready for anything
STR-1:

KEY-524462: [%person#1-I] suppose we'll have to wait and see. One or two players might find the match a bit too much but we'll handle things as we always do
STR-1:

KEY-524463: [%person#1-I]'ve been very clear to the players that we can't afford to listen to the noise around the match and focus squarely on doing our jobs. If they've listened, we'll be fine
STR-1:

KEY-524464: What are [%person#1-you] expecting ahead of [%person#1-your] latest head-to-head against rivals [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-524465: We're confident, we believe in ourselves, and we want to go out and make a real statement
STR-1:

KEY-524466: These matches are always challenging, but they're always exciting, and one of the dates on the fixture list [%person#1-I] always eagerly anticipate
STR-1:

KEY-524467: [%person#1-I] think it's fair to say we're the underdogs in this one, and we know how big of a task it'll be for us to get a result
STR-1:

KEY-524468: [%person#1-I] know the fans and the media look forward to these matches, but [%person#1-I] don't so much. We're really going to be up against it
STR-1:

KEY-524469: How much are [%person#1-you] stressing the importance of strong discipline from [%person#1-your] players in what can often be a heated atmosphere?
STR-1:

KEY-524470: We have to play with a clear focus on our gameplan and nothing else. We won't win if we get drawn away from that and lose our heads
STR-1:

KEY-524471: It's obviously important that we don't get drawn into doing anything silly; we have to keep eleven players on the pitch to give ourselves any chance of winning
STR-1:

KEY-524472: [%person#1-I] think this sort of match commands strong officiating. We need to go into the match prepared to stand up and be counted but, at the same time, we can't afford for poor decisions to cost us
STR-1:

KEY-524473: We're not going to roll over for anyone. This is a big match and we'll stand our ground and fight for a win
STR-1:

KEY-524474: Would [%person#1-you] agree that these matches add a little extra flavour to the [%comp#1-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-524475: These are the occasions that people look out for when the fixture lists are released, and [%person#1-I]'m no different. They're special
STR-1:

KEY-524476: When you get into football, these are the matches you want to be involved in. They make everything worthwhile
STR-1:

KEY-524477: [%person#1-I] can take them or leave them, every match means the same to [%person#1-me]
STR-1:

KEY-524478: [%person#1-I] don't like the distraction they bring, they're overhyped, and cause more headaches than celebrations
STR-1:

KEY-524479: What tactical challenges does such a big match throw at [%person#1-you]?
STR-1:

KEY-524480: We look at everything before every match, we prepare well, but we're always keen to dominate and assert our will over our opponents
STR-1:

KEY-524481: We will play as we always do, we'll take the game to them, and you'll see the rest come kick-off!
STR-1:

KEY-524482: It's just as important to avoid defeat as it is to win as far as [%person#1-I]'m concerned. That's all [%person#1-I]'ll say for now
STR-1:

KEY-524483: It's all about doing whatever it takes to win. A solid defensive approach goes a long way but we'll make sure we're ready for anything
STR-1:

KEY-524484: Should we expect changes to [%person#1-your] side to face [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-524485: Is there any team news [%person#1-you] can share ahead of your match against [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-524486: They'll call me the new Tinkerman if [%person#1-I] keep making changes but it's a long season and [%person#1-I] think it's important to keep players fresh
STR-1:

KEY-524487: [%person#1-I] believe changes will be made. You'll find out the specific alterations on matchday
STR-1:

KEY-524488: Our opponents pose a tactical challenge which will prompt me into making a few adjustments
STR-1:

KEY-524489: [%person#1-I]'m hoping for a settled team but fitness issues may mean we make some tweaks
STR-1:

KEY-524490: [%person#1-I]'m confident of gaining a positive result without the need for wholesale changes
STR-1:

KEY-524491: [%person#1-I]'m not a manager who enjoys making changes too often. You'll only see changes if I'm forced into making them
STR-1:

KEY-524492: You have to trust your players and [%person#1-I] certainly trust mine in this moment. [%person#1-I] feel changes could be counter-productive at this stage
STR-1:

KEY-524493: [%person#1-I]'m hoping to field an unchanged side that gives us the best chance of gaining a positive result
STR-1:

KEY-524494: How much pressure is there on [%person#1-you] ahead of such a big match against rivals like [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-524495: There's always pressure, that's the nature of the beast, and [%person#1-I] hope we can channel it into positivity
STR-1:

KEY-524496: [%person#1-I] never run away from a challenge, pressure is always good, so are a few nerves. That's why we do this job
STR-1:

KEY-524497: [%person#1-I]'m looking forward to it! This is when we do our best work, and the potential rewards are even bigger as a result
STR-1:

KEY-524498: Nothing fazes [%person#1-me] and [%person#1-I] hope [%person#1-I] can project that confidence onto [%person#1-my] players
STR-1:

KEY-524499: Would it mean more to [%person#1-you] to beat a rival?
STR-1:

KEY-524500: Do [%person#1-you] want to beat a rival any more than [%person#1-you] usually want to win?
STR-1:

KEY-524501: [%person#1-I] love the intensity of a local rivalry and [%person#1-I] think it's important that we assert our dominance
STR-1:

KEY-524502: [%person#1-I] don't think there's anything that matches the intensity of a match like that and [%person#1-I] always want to win these matches
STR-1:

KEY-524503: [%person#1-I] know how much these matches mean to the fans and that's why it's important we win
STR-1:

KEY-524504: These rivalries have outlasted just about everything else in football and that history enriches what we do. [%person#1-I] covet those wins most
STR-1:

KEY-524505: A win's a win to [%person#1-me], but [%person#1-I] understand why it might matter more to some people
STR-1:

KEY-524506: Rivalries of all types matter, not just local ones, and [%person#1-I]'m in the business of winning as often as possible
STR-1:

KEY-524507: If it matters to the fans, it matters to [%person#1-me]
STR-1:

KEY-524508: [%person#1-I] think it matters more to the fans, but that in turns guides the importance of each fixture for us and how we approach them
STR-1:

KEY-524509: Are [%person#1-your] intentions to attack from the off in this match?
STR-1:

KEY-524510: Should we expect to see an attacking approach for [%person#1-your] fixture against [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-524511: [%team#2-short] are next up for [%person#1-your] side. Will [%person#1-you] adopt an attacking approach from the start?
STR-1:

KEY-524512: [%person#1-My] philosophy is to attack from the first whistle and this match will be no different
STR-1:

KEY-524513: We don't know any other way. The message to the players is always to attack, score goals and win games in style
STR-1:

KEY-524514: The plan is always to take the game to the opposition. We will be ready to attack from minute one
STR-1:

KEY-524515: [%person#1-I]'m always keen to attack but we'll take into account the opponents' strengths too
STR-1:

KEY-524516: We'll certainly be hoping to wrestle the upper hand early on. [%person#1-I] always send my team out with the intention of playing positively
STR-1:

KEY-524517: Champagne football is the aim. Sometimes the tactics of the opponent can put a cork in that though
STR-1:

KEY-524518: [%person#1-I]'ll be setting my team up to win the game. Whether that involves forward thinking football is between [%person#1-me] and [%person#1-my] staff
STR-1:

KEY-524519: [%person#1-I] have respect for the opponent, [%person#1-I]'ll be adapting to a style which gives us the best chance of winning
STR-1:

KEY-524520: This is a results business. [%person#1-I] set my team up to win and that's the end of it
STR-1:

KEY-524521: Pragmatism is the name of the game. A more conservative approach may be needed to get a result
STR-1:

KEY-524522: Attacking football may be the fashionable way of playing in the modern game but history remembers the winners. The handbrake will be well and firmly on in this one
STR-1:

KEY-524523: Our first job is to be defensively solid. That's the platform for us to succeed and be able to attack in this match
STR-1:

KEY-524524: Might [%person#1-you] spring a tactical surprise or two here?
STR-1:

KEY-524525: Are [%person#1-you] plotting a surprise or two ahead of this match given how well [%team#2-short] seem to know [%person#1-your] team?
STR-1:

KEY-524526: [%person#1-I]'m always looking to find an edge to help us win. Expect the unexpected!
STR-1:

KEY-524527: [%person#1-I] know how we'll play, they don't. Simple
STR-1:

KEY-524528: [%person#1-I]'m confident our approach will give them something to think about
STR-1:

KEY-524529: We're prepared for anything and we'll be able to adjust during the match just as well as anyone
STR-1:

KEY-524530: [%person#1-I] don't think we'll surprise anyone, but we'll certainly be hard to beat
STR-1:

KEY-524531: Being predictable doesn't mean we're going to be easy to beat. [%person#1-I] invite anyone to give it a try
STR-1:

KEY-524532: [%person#1-I]'ll name [%person#1-my] starting eleven if you want. We fear nobody
STR-1:

KEY-524533: We have nothing to hide; [%person#1-I] know how good we are, let them try to stop us
STR-1:

KEY-524534: Do [%team#2-short] have enough about them to spring a surprise or two when the teams get out there?
STR-1:

KEY-524535: Are [%person#1-you] confident in [%person#2-your] preparation or are [%person#1-you] expecting any surprises from [%team#2-short]
STR-1:

KEY-524536: Every team has the capacity to surprise and [%person#1-I] always expect the unexpected
STR-1:

KEY-524537: We've prepared thoroughly but [%person#1-I] really wouldn't be shocked if a surprise or two comes our way
STR-1:

KEY-524538: [%person#1-I] don't know what to expect but they certainly have it in them to make us think twice
STR-1:

KEY-524539: [%person#1-I] really don't know what to expect and that probably means they will surprise us
STR-1:

KEY-524540: [%person#1-I] think we're prepared enough to be able to handle anything they throw at us
STR-1:

KEY-524541: [%person#1-I]'m not expecting anything unusual, we know who we're up against
STR-1:

KEY-524542: We're properly prepared and [%person#1-I]'m ready for anything
STR-1:

KEY-524543: They won't surprise us; [%person#1-I] know everything about them
STR-1:

KEY-524544: Does [%male#2] need to be rested for this match considering the fixture list right now?
STR-1:

KEY-524545: Are [%person#1-you] planning to rest [%male#2] any time soon considering that the fixture list seems to be taking a toll on his fitness?
STR-1:

KEY-524546: We'll need to make a few changes to make sure everyone stays fit and fresh, yeah
STR-1:

KEY-524547: Rotation is a normal part of football and [%male#2-first] will get a chance to rest for sure
STR-1:

KEY-524548: [%person#1-I] haven't decided for sure just yet but [%person#1-I] think he needs to take a little break sooner rather than later
STR-1:

KEY-524549: He'll get some rest pretty soon but [%person#1-I]'ve not decided whether it'll be in this match or not yet
STR-1:

KEY-524550: He'll play in this next match assuming there are no complications between now and kick-off
STR-1:

KEY-524551: He's more durable than people give him credit for, and [%person#1-I] intend to play him here, although we'll keep an eye on his fitness
STR-1:

KEY-524552: Some people might think we're taking a risk but he'll be playing
STR-1:

KEY-524553: [%person#1-I]'m not planning on resting him, even if some people think it's a risk; [%person#1-I] think it's a risk worth taking
STR-1:

KEY-524554: Will [%person#1-you] be making changes with the match against [%team#3-short] coming up quickly on the horizon?
STR-1:

KEY-524555: It makes sense to rotate the squad a bit, yes. [%person#1-I] might have done it anyway but the [%team#3-short] match certainly factors into our preparations
STR-1:

KEY-524556: We take a long-term look towards our fixture list to try to make sure everyone's fresh, and that'll likely mean we need to make some changes, yeah
STR-1:

KEY-524557: Our focus is squarely on [%team#2-short] and we're not looking any further ahead than that match
STR-1:

KEY-524558: [%person#1-I]'ll talk about the [%team#3-short] match when we get to it. For now, we'll pick the strongest team we can to play [%team#2-short]
STR-1:

KEY-524559: Will [%person#1-your] team against [%team#2-short] be picked with [%person#1-your] upcoming schedule in mind?
STR-1:

KEY-524560: Does [%team#1-short]{s} upcoming schedule mean the team picked to play [%team#2-short] might be heavily rotated?
STR-1:

KEY-524561: We need to change the team around, that's clear
STR-1:

KEY-524562: There's no way we can get through this run without giving everyone in the squad some playing time
STR-1:

KEY-524563: [%person#1-I] have to at least think about regular rotation and giving everyone a chance to make a contribution
STR-1:

KEY-524564: We'll take it game by game but [%person#1-I]'d be surprised if we didn't make a few changes here and there
STR-1:

KEY-524565: [%person#1-I] think we've got such a strong squad what, whatever team [%person#1-I] pick, we're going to give you a good game
STR-1:

KEY-524566: [%person#1-I] respect each and every opponent and we'll make sure that our teams are picked with the intent to go out and win
STR-1:

KEY-524567: [%person#1-I] think we're in a good place to tackle the fixture list without making mass changes
STR-1:

KEY-524568: [%person#1-I] wouldn't expect mass changes; we've shown we can handle a packed schedule
STR-1:

KEY-524569: Can [%person#1-you] talk about why [%person#1-your] teams tend to play the way they do?
STR-1:

KEY-524570: Are [%person#1-you] able to offer any insight into the reasons behind [%person#1-your] current tactical approach?
STR-1:

KEY-524571: [%person#1-I] believe football should be played in a certain style and in a certain way. That guides [%person#1-my] principles of play
STR-1:

KEY-524572: [%person#1-I] think people have grown accustomed to enjoying a certain style of play that is entertaining and attractive and [%person#1-I] try to deliver that too
STR-1:

KEY-524573: [%person#1-I] know this style of play and it's what [%person#1-I] feel most comfortable coaching
STR-1:

KEY-524574: This is what [%person#1-I] know, this is how [%person#1-I]'ve always seen football, and [%person#1-I] feel confident in [%person#1-my] ability to teach it
STR-1:

KEY-524575: [%person#1-I]'m a pragmatist so the honest answer is that we play like this to win
STR-1:

KEY-524576: [%person#1-I]'m paid to win football matches and so [%person#1-I] do what [%person#1-I] can to give us the best chance of doing that regularly
STR-1:

KEY-524577: This style of play works for the squad [%person#1-I] have at [%person#1-my] disposal, that's why
STR-1:

KEY-524578: [%person#1-I] know the players in [%person#1-my] squad and [%person#1-I] know what works for them. That's smart management if you ask [%person#1-me]
STR-1:

KEY-524579: What sort of response are [%person#1-you] looking for from [%person#1-your] players after a disappointing result against [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-524580: [%person#1-You] must be after a reaction following such a disappointing result against [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-524581: We know we weren't good enough against [%team#2-short] and we need to make up for that here
STR-1:

KEY-524582: It's important that we respond to setbacks in the right way and [%person#1-I]'m looking for that sort of performance here
STR-1:

KEY-524583: We've shown the right attitude in training since that setback and it's time to take that into the match now
STR-1:

KEY-524584: [%person#1-I] hope it strengthens our resolve to make sure we respond positively
STR-1:

KEY-524585: It's never easy to suffer a disappointment and recover quickly. We'll do what we can but it might take some time
STR-1:

KEY-524586: [%person#1-I]'m not expecting an instant turnaround; these things are sometimes hard to shake off, but we'll certainly try
STR-1:

KEY-524587: This is a really important match for us because another defeat could be even more damaging
STR-1:

KEY-524588: [%person#1-I] won't lie, [%person#1-I]'m concerned ahead of this match; we might not be able to absorb another disappointing result quite so soon
STR-1:

KEY-524589: How do [%person#1-you] get [%person#1-your] team to repeat the sort of performance they put in against [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-524590: How challenging is it for [%person#1-you] to get [%person#1-your] players to play as well here as they did against [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-524591: Those performances give us the confidence to carry forward and do even better the next time
STR-1:

KEY-524592: The confidence is starting to flow and [%person#1-I] think everyone's really excited about where we are right now
STR-1:

KEY-524593: We just have to keep working hard. If we do that, the possibilities are endless
STR-1:

KEY-524594: We're nothing without hard work. [%person#1-I]'m confident that we can go from strength to strength as long as we maintain that work ethic
STR-1:

KEY-524595: We can't become complacent. We need to leave the past behind us and renew our focus moving forward
STR-1:

KEY-524596: It's important not to dwell on good wins and lose focus on what's up ahead. [%person#1-I]'ve been stressing that to the players
STR-1:

KEY-524597: It's about focus and concentration. Now is the time for us to show that we're a mentally strong team
STR-1:

KEY-524598: We talk about physical toughness but this is a mental challenge for us now. Focus is more important than ever.
STR-1:

KEY-524599: How much of this good run of form has been due to the positive atmosphere around the club?
STR-1:

KEY-524600: Do [%person#1-you] think this good run of form owes a lot to the positive atmosphere around the club?
STR-1:

KEY-524601: One informs the other; the better we play, the happier we are, and so on
STR-1:

KEY-524602: It all comes back to confidence. If we're enjoying our football, everything seems so much easier
STR-1:

KEY-524603: We're having fun right now and that's the best way to work. A happy club is a successful club
STR-1:

KEY-524604: There's definitely something to the suggestion that we're able to play better because we're enjoying our football
STR-1:

KEY-524605: [%person#1-I] think we usually have a good atmosphere here, whether we're in form or not. That's the type of workplace atmosphere [%person#1-I] try to cultivate
STR-1:

KEY-524606: Look, we stay together through the good times and the bad. The work we've put in to building this atmosphere is the most important thing of all
STR-1:

KEY-524607: [%person#1-I] can't work around an idea of spirit; what we do in training and how we go about our business drives everything else
STR-1:

KEY-524608: For [%person#1-me], it's all about hard work. What you're talking about is the result of the effort we put in each and every day
STR-1:

KEY-524609: How have [%person#1-your] plans for this match been affected by the international break where several of [%person#1-your] players were away with their national teams?
STR-1:

KEY-524610: [%person#1-I] can't wait to get back to it. We've used the break to work on one or two things and hopefully we'll be better for that
STR-1:

KEY-524611: We know how the calendar works and we've planned around it as best we can. There's no point in looking backwards, we're focused on what's to come
STR-1:

KEY-524612: [%person#1-I]'m obviously a little concerned about the physical aspect of this, and who might and might not be available, but we're not the only team facing those problems
STR-1:

KEY-524613: [%person#1-I] really don't think international football should be played during the club season, but that's maybe a different debate for another time
STR-1:

KEY-524614: Does the packed fixture list mean [%person#1-you]'re likely to rotate the squad a little?
STR-1:

KEY-524615: [%person#1-I] think it's inevitable to some extent; we need to use the whole squad
STR-1:

KEY-524616: [%person#1-I]'m sure there are some players who are due a rest and so we'll have to consider what we do with the starting eleven
STR-1:

KEY-524617: Maybe, [%person#1-I] wouldn't say we have to rotate, there's a balance to be had between fitness and performance
STR-1:

KEY-524618: [%person#1-I]'m not expecting to make any changes, certainly not right now
STR-1:

KEY-524619: Do [%person#1-you] worry about a bad result that damages morale?
STR-1:

KEY-524620: How concerned are [%person#1-you] about suffering a defeat that leaves morale suffering?
STR-1:

KEY-524621: [%person#1-I] think the mood around the camp is good and there's no reason for that to change
STR-1:

KEY-524622: We win together and we lose together; [%person#1-I]'m not worried about the happiness of the players in that dressing room
STR-1:

KEY-524623: We're a strong group and [%person#1-I] don't think a defeat here or there is going to hurt us in that regard
STR-1:

KEY-524624: [%person#1-I] think we're strong enough to withstand bad moments; one defeat won't bring us down
STR-1:

KEY-524625: Those challenges come for every team eventually and we'll need to prove that we have the resolve to overcome the bad times
STR-1:

KEY-524626: We need to prove that we can handle both the good times and the bad with the same spirit and camaraderie
STR-1:

KEY-524627: [%person#1-I]'m under no illusions that the good times will last forever. When the hard times come, [%person#1-I] need to earn [%person#1-my] salary
STR-1:

KEY-524628: We'll undoubtedly suffer a setback eventually and it's at that point when [%person#1-I] have to make sure we stick together
STR-1:

KEY-524629: Are [%person#1-you] worried about motivating [%person#1-your] players to face [%team#2-short]? Is there a danger of complacency?
STR-1:

KEY-524630: Complacency can creep in at any time and it's [%person#1-my] job to make sure we're fully engaged with the task at hand
STR-1:

KEY-524631: [%team#2-short] are a very good team and we can't afford to think we've won this before a ball has been kicked. We have to prepare the same as we do for every opponent
STR-1:

KEY-524632: [%person#1-I]'m not too worried, [%person#1-my] players know their jobs, and they know how important it is to prepare in the right way
STR-1:

KEY-524633: [%person#1-I] don't think we'll have to worry about complacency. We're focused on doing our jobs
STR-1:

KEY-524634: How important is [%male#2] ahead of the [%team#2-short] clash? He's a big game player, right?
STR-1:

KEY-524635: [%male#2] is the sort of big-game player [%person#1-you] must be relying on ahead of the [%team#2-short] clash?
STR-1:

KEY-524636: He lives for these games and hopefully he'll produce the goods again
STR-1:

KEY-524637: He's a manager's dream and [%person#1-I] think we'll all lean heavily on him
STR-1:

KEY-524638: He's been ready for this game for weeks, he can't wait!
STR-1:

KEY-524639: We're very lucky as a team to have him and he's ready to do a job for us here
STR-1:

KEY-524640: [%person#1-My] focus is all on the team and not the player; he'll play, but [%person#1-I] think he can take his game to another level
STR-1:

KEY-524641: [%person#1-I] know what he's capable of and [%person#1-I] want to see him reach those heights more consistently, starting here
STR-1:

KEY-524642: We win as a team and we lose as a team. That's how it'll always be
STR-1:

KEY-524643: [%person#1-I]'m only focused on working out how we can win as a team, nothing else
STR-1:

KEY-524644: Do [%person#1-you] think [%male#2]{s} unique set of skills can make the difference against [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-524645: Does [%male#2] have the key attributes to unpick [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-524646: Can one player make the difference today? Would [%person#1-you] say [%male#2] could be that player?
STR-1:

KEY-524647: Everyone seems to think [%male#2] will be the difference-maker today. What's [%person#1-your] opinion?
STR-1:

KEY-524648: Maybe
STR-1:

KEY-524649: You'll be the ones writing the headlines. We're a team and we win or lose as a team
STR-1:

KEY-524650: He's certainly an able footballer. We'll all have to perform to a high level though, that's the main thing
STR-1:

KEY-524651: We'll have to wait and see won't we?
STR-1:

KEY-524652: He's an exceptional player and any team would kill to have him in their starting line-up
STR-1:

KEY-524653: For [%person#1-me] he's the best player on the pitch every time he crosses that line. He'll do what's required.
STR-1:

KEY-524654: You can't put a value on a player like [%male#2-first]. He always delivers when it matters
STR-1:

KEY-524655: As a player and a person [%male#2-first] is quality through and through. He's exactly what we'll need if this club is going to succeed
STR-1:

KEY-524656: He's a player we can rely on in these kind of games
STR-1:

KEY-524657: [%person#1-I] know [%male#2-first] can perform to a good standard in games like these
STR-1:

KEY-524658: [%person#1-I] believe in [%male#2-first] and his abilities. He'll be important for sure
STR-1:

KEY-524659: [%male#2-first] is a solid choice for this kind of game. He makes [%person#1-my] job easy when it comes to choosing the team
STR-1:

KEY-524660: [%male#2-first] alone can't win a match. It's always about the team and that's no different for this one
STR-1:

KEY-524661: Everyone knows that [%male#2-first] has plenty of ability. But don't make the mistake of thinking one person can win a football match
STR-1:

KEY-524662: He's a good player. That much is obvious. But we come at this one just like any match, we've got to prepare, plan and win as a group
STR-1:

KEY-524663: Perhaps he'll make the difference. But [%person#1-I] wish you'd recognise the efforts of the rest of the team
STR-1:

KEY-524664: Your job is to ask these questions, and [%person#1-mine] is to answer. But [%person#1-I] really can't say what difference he'll make
STR-1:

KEY-524665: One player, no matter how talented, doesn't a victory make
STR-1:

KEY-524666: [%person#1-My] opinion is that someone else is actually the key to unlocking this one. Not telling you who though
STR-1:

KEY-524667: Another inane question. Yes he can play. No he won't win it on his own
STR-1:

KEY-524668: Do you believe [%male#2]{s} unique skillset could make the difference against [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-524669: Do you think the way [%male#2] plays could make him ideal for this game?
STR-1:

KEY-524670: Let's talk about [%male#2]. He's surely got the ideal profile for this match?
STR-1:

KEY-524671: Reports from the club suggest [%male#2]{s} going to be [%person#1-your] go-to for this one. Care to comment?
STR-1:

KEY-524672: Could be
STR-1:

KEY-524673: Perhaps. [%person#1-I] wouldn't say [%person#1-I]{ve} made up my mind yet
STR-1:

KEY-524674: Possibly. He's a good player but luckily [%person#1-I]'m blessed with more than one good player
STR-1:

KEY-524675: We'll all find out together won't we?
STR-1:

KEY-524676: He's our not so secret weapon isn't he? [%person#1-I]'m confident in what he can bring
STR-1:

KEY-524677: [%person#1-I]'m delighted to have him available as always. He can change a game in the blink of an eye
STR-1:

KEY-524678: What he does for us cannot be overstated. It's an honour to work with someone so capable
STR-1:

KEY-524679: [%male#2-first] is absolutely in his prime isn't he? We're extremely fortunate that we can bring his ability to bear on this competition
STR-1:

KEY-524680: [%person#1-I]'d imagine he'll pop up with something. He's irrepressible
STR-1:

KEY-524681: When you've got as much in your locker as [%male#2-first] has you can't help but make a difference
STR-1:

KEY-524682: [%male#2-first] makes it look easy. [%person#1-I] pretty confident his ability will shine through
STR-1:

KEY-524683: [%person#1-I]'d be jealous if [%male#2-first] played for anyone else. Given he's on our side, [%person#1-I]'m feeling pretty good about the match and [%person#1-I]'m pretty confident his ability will shine through
STR-1:

KEY-524684: We'll see. You lot love to pile on the pressure ahead of a big match
STR-1:

KEY-524685: [%person#1-I]'m playing my cards close to my chest on this one. He might not even make the bench
STR-1:

KEY-524686: It's not right to single one player out like this. We'll all need to work together if we're going to win
STR-1:

KEY-524687: Everyone has exceptional qualities. Perhaps his will come to the fore, perhaps someone else
STR-1:

KEY-524688: [%person#1-I] clearly don't rate him as much as you
STR-1:

KEY-524689: Let's just wait and see shall we? He's not as good as you think he is
STR-1:

KEY-524690: The press talk players up all the time. [%person#1-I] prefer to let the football do the talking
STR-1:

KEY-524691: If [%person#1-I] were the gambling type [%person#1-my] money wouldn't be on him to make the difference
STR-1:

KEY-524692: How much easier is life as a manager when [%person#1-you] have [%male#2] in [%person#1-your] squad?
STR-1:

KEY-524693: Does a player like [%male#2], with his versatility, make life easier for [%person#1-you]?
STR-1:

KEY-524694: [%person#1-I]'d have a squad of players like [%male#2-first] if [%person#1-I] could! He's outstanding and solves so many problems
STR-1:

KEY-524695: The versatility to adapt to different circumstances while maintaining high standards is something [%person#1-I] value in a player and he's one of the very best as far as [%person#1-I]'m concerned
STR-1:

KEY-524696: He gives us a better chance of winning and that's what [%person#1-I] like most about him
STR-1:

KEY-524697: When you can bring the quality that he has and you can do it in different positions, it makes such a difference. [%person#1-I] think the world of him
STR-1:

KEY-524698: As good as he is, he's just one player, and it's how the rest of the team perform that determines whether we win or lose
STR-1:

KEY-524699: It's a team game and, as big of a fan as [%person#1-I] am of his, we'd all do well to remember that
STR-1:

KEY-524700: [%person#1-I] often think that we could get even more out of him by focusing on one position and seeing just how dominant he could be there
STR-1:

KEY-524701: Versatility is a fine trait but maybe we need to look at narrowing the scope of his workload and focusing on one position now
STR-1:

KEY-524702: How do [%person#1-you] think [%male#2] has been faring as {an}[%tactical_role#2]?
STR-1:

KEY-524703: Can [%person#1-you] talk a little bit about how [%male#2] has been playing as {an}[%tactical_role#2]?
STR-1:

KEY-524704: [%person#1-I]'m happy with how he's playing and [%person#1-I] don't expect to make changes any time soon
STR-1:

KEY-524705: He's doing a good job and long may it continue
STR-1:

KEY-524706: As long as he's playing well, [%person#1-I]'ll keep playing him there. Don't fix something that isn't broken
STR-1:

KEY-524707: He's doing fine and that's alright by [%person#1-me]. Let's hope he carries on in that way
STR-1:

KEY-524708: [%person#1-I]'m not saying [%person#1-I]'ll drop him but nobody's place in this team is ever certain. We'll pick the team that gives us the best chance of winning
STR-1:

KEY-524709: He's been alright but [%person#1-I] always have to pick the right team to win each match. His place, like everyone else's, is never certain
STR-1:

KEY-524710: [%team#2-short] are a really hard opponent for us and [%person#1-I] might be forced into making some changes to his role
STR-1:

KEY-524711: [%person#1-I] might have to give strong consideration to his role in the team ahead of the [%team#2-short] match; they're a formidable opponent
STR-1:

KEY-524712: How valuable is it for [%person#1-you] to have a player so comfortable with the ball as [%male#2] is when [%person#1-you] set up [%person#1-your] team?
STR-1:

KEY-524713: How big of a player is [%male#2] for [%person#1-you] in terms of how [%person#1-you] want to play?
STR-1:

KEY-524714: We can't play the way we want to without him, simple. He's the key
STR-1:

KEY-524715: He's a key player and facilitates much of our style of play
STR-1:

KEY-524716: He has the trust of everyone in the team and he runs the show as far as we're concerned
STR-1:

KEY-524717: [%person#1-I] think he's such an important player and [%person#1-I] trust him implicitly
STR-1:

KEY-524718: Look, he's a great player, but it's never all about the individual. We're a team and that's how we focus on things
STR-1:

KEY-524719: [%person#1-I]'m his biggest fan but it's more important that we talk about the team in terms of how we play and how we hope to win
STR-1:

KEY-524720: Everyone know what he's capable of, so it's [%person#1-my] job to see if he can scale even greater heights
STR-1:

KEY-524721: [%person#1-I]'m always on the lookout for even more improvements so, as good as he is, [%person#1-my] job is to take him to the next level
STR-1:

KEY-524722: How important is a player with [%male#2]{s} physical traits to what [%person#1-you] do as [%team#1-short] manager?
STR-1:

KEY-524723: How much do [%person#1-you] rely on [%male#2]{s} physical excellence when going about planning for each match?
STR-1:

KEY-524724: He's the very definition of a game changer and [%person#1-I] never take that for granted
STR-1:

KEY-524725: [%person#1-I]'m so lucky to have such a game-changing talent like him in [%person#1-my] squad
STR-1:

KEY-524726: [%person#1-I] think he's a manager's dream and [%person#1-I]'m looking forward to using him in as many different ways as possible
STR-1:

KEY-524727: He's absolutely one of our most important players and [%person#1-I] think [%person#1-I]'m a very lucky manager
STR-1:

KEY-524728: As good as he is, focusing on individuals isn't [%person#1-my] thing; [%person#1-I] have a team to manage
STR-1:

KEY-524729: [%person#1-I] appreciate every player on an individual level but we must remember that we win and lose as a team
STR-1:

KEY-524730: [%person#1-I] appreciate what he can do, but now is the time when [%person#1-I] ask [%person#1-myself] 'what else is he capable of?'
STR-1:

KEY-524731: He is a top player, but [%person#1-I]'m always looking for more, and [%person#1-I] want to challenge him to be even better
STR-1:

KEY-524732: How important are [%male#2]{s} leadership credentials to [%person#1-your] team?
STR-1:

KEY-524733: He's absolutely vital and he really brings everything together in a way few other players can
STR-1:

KEY-524734: [%person#1-I] don't think we could do without him, he's someone we all rely on
STR-1:

KEY-524735: [%person#1-I] think very highly of him but, at the same time, it's never wise to focus too much on just one player
STR-1:

KEY-524736: He's a very important player, but [%person#1-I]'m always keen to ask for more, and he's not excluded from that
STR-1:

KEY-524737: [%male#2] has the physical and technical ability to change a game. Just how important is he?
STR-1:

KEY-524738: How valuable is [%male#2] to [%person#2-your] plans? He seems to have everything the modern footballer needs to be successful.
STR-1:

KEY-524739: He is a gift and [%person#1-I] am very lucky to have him
STR-1:

KEY-524740: [%person#1-I] can't speak highly enough of him. He's outstanding in every way
STR-1:

KEY-524741: He makes [%person#1-me] look good! He's a special talent and [%person#1-I] think he's so important to what we do
STR-1:

KEY-524742: [%person#1-I] think any manager would love to have a player of his calibre and [%person#1-I]'m no different
STR-1:

KEY-524743: [%person#1-I] think we all know how good he is, but we should always remember to focus on the team
STR-1:

KEY-524744: He's a great player but we're only as good as we are as a team, not as individuals
STR-1:

KEY-524745: [%person#1-I] know how good he is, but [%person#1-I]'m more interested in how good he can be. We're always looking for more
STR-1:

KEY-524746: He'll be the first to tell you that it's about what you do next. We're trying to find ways to make him even better
STR-1:

KEY-524747: [%male#2] always seems to be in the right place and never seems to slow down. Just how good is he?
STR-1:

KEY-524748: How valuable is [%male#2]? His engine and his ability to read the play seems to be unrivalled in [%person#1-your] squad?
STR-1:

KEY-524749: Who reported that? [%person#1-I] won't answer questions regarding unidentified sources
STR-1:

KEY-524750: [%male#2-surname] is cut off by [%male#1-surname]{s} slide tackle
STR-1:

KEY-524751: [%male#2-surname] is brought to a halt by [%male#1-surname]
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-524765: Delighted regardless of outcome[%person#1-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-524766: We should be winning this trophy. Don't come back empty-handed.
STR-1:

KEY-524767: Proud[%person#1-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-524768: Our goal difference is good enough to pretty much book our top section place if we avoid defeat here.
STR-1:

KEY-524770: I won't be threatened. I'll be professional, but the rest of the squad will certainly be hearing about this.
STR-1: Tôi sẽ không bị đe dọa. Tôi sẽ chuyên nghiệp, nhưng phần còn lại của đội chắc chắn sẽ nghe về điều này.

KEY-524771: [%person#1-surname] ignores criticism
STR-1:

KEY-524772: Some of them are a bit frustrated and getting a little restless, but that's something we'll just have to deal with
STR-1:

KEY-524773: Our focus is squarely on our football club. Everybody else can talk as much as they want, it won't make any difference here
STR-1:

KEY-524774: We have to take a positive approach here; it's unfortunate to lose him, but someone else just got an opportunity to impress
STR-1:

KEY-524775: With no disrespect to [%male#2-first], we have to look to the next player up. Someone's misfortune is someone else's chance to shine
STR-1:

KEY-524776: It's terrible news for him, [%person#1-I]'m disappointed for him as much as anything else
STR-1:

KEY-524777: [%person#1-I]'m so disappointed not just to lose him, but also for him, as he was looking forward to being involved
STR-1:

KEY-524778: We're all gutted for him, it's the worst news
STR-1:

KEY-524779: [%person#1-I]'m gutted; to be without a player like him makes everything that much harder
STR-1:

KEY-524780: What are [%person#2-your] thoughts about [%team#2-short] lighting up the [%comp#1-short] so far this season?
STR-1:

KEY-524781: They've been a real breath of fresh air and [%person#1-I]'ve really enjoyed watching them. They deserve a ton of credit
STR-1:

KEY-524782: [%person#1-I]'ve found their progress fascinating and [%person#1-I]'d like to see them keep going for as long as possible.
STR-1:

KEY-524783: They've captured the attention, haven't they? It's been great fun but they'll probably struggle to keep it going into the long-term future.
STR-1:

KEY-524784: [%person#1-I] understand why people have latched on to their story but [%person#1-I]'ve heard enough to be honest. Lots of teams are playing well!
STR-1:

KEY-524785: What do [%person#1-you] make of [%team#2-short]{s} struggles this season given their expectations heading into the season?
STR-1:

KEY-524786: Form is temporary, class is permanent. [%person#1-I] have no doubts they'll put this behind them and show who they really are before much longer
STR-1:

KEY-524787: There's too much quality in their squad for these hard times to last much longer. They'll right the ship, [%person#1-I]'m sure.
STR-1:

KEY-524788: Everyone seems to have been taken by surprise but, if you ask [%person#1-me], there were signs of this happening a long time ago. It's not surprising
STR-1:

KEY-524789: [%person#1-I] probably shouldn't say this, but it's really funny, isn't it?!
STR-1:

KEY-524790: He's a quality player who any manager would love to have in their team. [%person#1-I] don't know if a deal can be done but [%person#1-I] hope so
STR-1:

KEY-524791: He's an option we've had among our targets for a while but it might be premature to say we've made a bid
STR-1:

KEY-524792: That's the first [%person#1-I]'ve heard of it
STR-1:

KEY-524793: Nope, that's nothing to do with us
STR-1:

KEY-524794: Can we expect any business from [%team#1-short] before the transfer window closes?
STR-1:

KEY-524795: We're looking at our options and [%person#1-I] think there's a chance we'll do something
STR-1:

KEY-524796: Never say never, that's all [%person#1-I]'ll say
STR-1:

KEY-524797: [%person#1-I] don't think so, not unless something changes anyway
STR-1:

KEY-524798: No, we won't be active, you can focus your attentions elsewhere
STR-1:

KEY-524799: How do [%person#1-you] feel [%person#2-your] squad could be improved?
STR-1:

KEY-524800: How would [%person#1-you] go about improving the [%team#1-short] squad?
STR-1:

KEY-524801: [%person#1-I] think it's clear that we need more options in attack
STR-1:

KEY-524802: [%person#1-I] don't think anyone could argue with the suggestion that we're a player or two light in attack
STR-1:

KEY-524803: If you gave [%person#1-me] a couple of new midfielders [%person#1-I]'d be very happy
STR-1:

KEY-524804: We need to be better in midfield, really. That's where games are won and lost
STR-1:

KEY-524805: We're not good enough in defence and that's something [%person#1-I]'m trying to work on
STR-1:

KEY-524806: [%person#1-I] don't think we have the right level of quality in defence right now
STR-1:

KEY-524807: Having more competition in goal isn't a bad idea
STR-1:

KEY-524808: [%person#1-I] wouldn't mind having another option in goal
STR-1:

KEY-524809: Can [%person#1-you] comment on rumours linking [%team#1-short] with [%male#3]?
STR-1:

KEY-524810: Is there anything in stories connecting [%team#1-short] with a move for [%male#3]?
STR-1:

KEY-524811: He's a player we admire and, if someone of his quality is available, of course we'll explore the opportunity
STR-1:

KEY-524812: We're always interested in good players, and he's certainly one, so make of that what you will
STR-1:

KEY-524813: [%person#1-I] think he's a good player but [%person#1-I] wouldn't want to say any more than that at this stage
STR-1:

KEY-524814: He's a good footballer, everyone knows that, and we'll see that the future brings
STR-1:

KEY-524815: We have hundreds of players on our radar and it'd be premature to say anything about a deal
STR-1:

KEY-524816: He's a player of interest, just like countless others, and to say there's going to be any movement would be premature in the extreme
STR-1:

KEY-524817: [%person#1-I]'d hope we're able to attract players of that calibre, but that's all it is right now, hope
STR-1:

KEY-524818: [%person#1-I] could only dream of bringing him in! It's hope and nothing more at this stage
STR-1:

KEY-524819: Do [%person#1-you] think [%team#2-short] are willing to make an offer for [%male#3]?
STR-1:

KEY-524820: Are [%person#1-you] expecting to receive a bid from [%team#2-short] for [%male#3]?
STR-1:

KEY-524821: [%person#1-I] don't want to keep a player here if he has no interest in staying. If and when a bid arrives, we'll deal with it then
STR-1:

KEY-524822: [%person#1-I]'m the sort of manager who's always willing to talk business and, if it works for everyone, [%person#1-I]'m sure we can come to an agreement
STR-1:

KEY-524823: [%person#1-I]'m open to selling anyone at the right price, but [%person#1-I] do stress it has to be the right price
STR-1:

KEY-524824: If [%team#2-short] or anyone else is willing to meet our valuation then we can talk
STR-1:

KEY-524825: [%person#1-I]'m not interested in speculation but it should go without saying that [%person#1-I] want to keep [%person#1-my] best players at the club
STR-1:

KEY-524826: [%person#1-I]'m sure plenty of teams are interested in [%male#3-surname] but [%person#1-I]'m not interested in selling him
STR-1:

KEY-524827: He's going nowhere, end of discussion
STR-1:

KEY-524828: [%person#1-I] can tell you all right now that he's not for sale, and [%person#1-I] hope [%team#2-short] are listening too
STR-1:

KEY-524829: Does the leaking out of [%person#1-your] interest in [%male#3] make it harder for [%person#1-you] to pursue a deal?
STR-1:

KEY-524830: How annoyed are [%person#1-you] that [%person#1-your] reported interest in [%male#3] has now become public knowledge?
STR-1:

KEY-524831: It happens, [%person#1-I] expected it to happen, and [%person#1-I] don't think it'll affect our chances of doing a deal
STR-1:

KEY-524832: We live in a twenty-four hour news cycle these days so it was inevitable. [%person#1-I] don't think it'll affect our chances of striking a deal
STR-1:

KEY-524833: [%person#1-I] really don't think it matters; [%person#1-I] wouldn't even have known if you hadn't told [%person#1-me]
STR-1:

KEY-524834: [%person#1-I] don't think it matters to be honest, [%person#1-I]'m certainly not concerned
STR-1:

KEY-524835: It's a little disappointing because we prefer to keep our business quiet, but at the same time [%person#1-I] don't think it'll do much damage, it's just frustrating that someone would leak it
STR-1:

KEY-524836: Maybe [%person#1-I]'m a little frustrated because it's a breakdown in trust, but that's life, and we'll keep on trying to find an agreement
STR-1:

KEY-524837: [%person#1-I]'m really annoyed because these deals are predicated on trust and that trust has been eroded by this news
STR-1:

KEY-524838: [%person#1-I]'m not happy at all; why would someone leak confidential information like this? How is it helpful in any way?
STR-1:

KEY-524839: With [%person#2] spotted watching [%male#3] today, would [%person#1-you] consider selling to [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-524840: [%male#2] has come under increasing scrutiny and pressure recently; are [%person#1-you] confident he can handle that?
STR-1:

KEY-524841: We're always open for business. Whether a deal happens or not is a different question
STR-1:

KEY-524842: [%person#1-I]'ll always talk to other clubs about business because [%person#1-I] think it's important to be open to discussion. We'll see what happens
STR-1:

KEY-524843: [%person#1-I] won't say yes and [%person#1-I] won't say no. You can all write 'refused to rule it out' if you want
STR-1:

KEY-524844: Football's a funny game and anything could happen. [%person#1-I]'ve learned not to rule anything out these days
STR-1:

KEY-524845: [%person#1-I]'m not interested in selling him
STR-1:

KEY-524846: Maybe [%person#2-first] came to watch us because we play such good football? [%person#1-I] hope so, because we're not selling anyone
STR-1:

KEY-524847: Quote [%person#1-me] on this right now; he's not for sale
STR-1:

KEY-524848: We're not selling him, it's that simple
STR-1:

KEY-524849: [%person#1-I]'d be irresponsible if [%person#1-I] wasn't thinking about the future of this club. Signing these kinds of players gives us a better chance of a bright future
STR-1:

KEY-524850: Would [%person#1-you] like to keep [%male#3] at [%team#1-short] permanently?
STR-1:

KEY-524851: Are [%person#1-you] hopeful of keeping [%male#3] at [%team#1-short] beyond the end of this loan deal?
STR-1:

KEY-524852: He's been great and we'll definitely explore that possibility at the right time
STR-1:

KEY-524853: [%person#1-I] want to keep our best players at the club and that's certainly the case with [%male#3-first]
STR-1:

KEY-524854: We're interested, but there's a long way to go before we can talk about that in any detail
STR-1:

KEY-524855: [%person#1-I] think any club in our situation would be interested but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it
STR-1:

KEY-524856: [%person#1-I] don't know; for now, we're happy to have him on loan
STR-1:

KEY-524857: We'll have to see; [%person#1-I]'m not currently looking any further ahead than the end of his loan stay
STR-1:

KEY-524858: [%person#1-I] don't think it's going to happen, for many reasons
STR-1:

KEY-524859: [%person#1-I] wouldn't expect to see anything like that happen
STR-1:

KEY-524860: Have [%person#1-you] chosen to recall [%male#2] from his loan spell at [%team#2-short] because of his current injury situation?
STR-1:

KEY-524861: Did [%person#1-you] bring [%male#2] back from his loan at [%team#2-short] because of injury?
STR-1:

KEY-524862: [%person#1-surname] explains [%male#2-surname] return
STR-1:

KEY-524863: [%person#1-surname] talks [%male#2-surname] returning from loan
STR-1:

KEY-524864: [%person#1-surname]: We want the best for [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-524865: [%person#1-surname] considers next steps for [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-524866: [%person#1-I] don't think we need to talk about him right now
STR-1:

KEY-524867: Yeah, we wanted to bring him back in-house so we can manage his injury situation and get him back to full fitness
STR-1:

KEY-524868: We felt it was better for him to come back here and work his way back to full fitness with our team
STR-1:

KEY-524869: He's had a few struggles physically so we thought it best to get him back here and help him more closely
STR-1:

KEY-524870: He's had some injury problems so it's the right decision for everyone to bring him back and plan a course of action that helps him
STR-1:

KEY-524871: We just want the best for him and, right now, that means cutting his loan short
STR-1:

KEY-524872: The injuries are a part of it but we want to do right by him and give him the best chance of making good progress
STR-1:

KEY-524873: Football has plenty of ups and downs; bringing him back isn't the important thing, it's working out what we do with him next
STR-1:

KEY-524874: It doesn't matter so much why we've brought him back, it's what we do next that's more important, and we'll be plotting a course of action accordingly
STR-1:

KEY-524875: Have [%person#1-you] chosen to recall [%male#2] from his loan spell at [%team#2-short] because of a lack of regular playing time?
STR-1:

KEY-524876: Did [%person#1-you] bring [%male#2] back from his loan at [%team#2-short] because of he wasn't playing often enough?
STR-1:

KEY-524877: He needs to play regularly and that clearly wasn't happening at [%team#2-short]
STR-1:

KEY-524878: [%team#2-short] weren't making the best use of his skills so we felt it was best to cut that arrangement off early
STR-1:

KEY-524879: Of course we wanted him to play regularly. That wasn't quite the case, so we decided to bring him back
STR-1:

KEY-524880: He thought he deserved more playing time than he was getting, and that meant taking him back earlier than scheduled
STR-1:

KEY-524881: Sometimes it's right to let a player work through the challenge of wanting more playing time, but this wasn't one of those occasions; we want what's best for him
STR-1:

KEY-524882: We let things play out and it was clear he wasn't getting the minutes he needed, and that's really what this comes down to, what's best for the player
STR-1:

KEY-524883: Sometimes things don't go as planned. When that happens, it's important to hit reset and consider the next steps to take to help improve things
STR-1:

KEY-524884: It wasn't going to plan for him at [%team#1-short], so now we need to discuss what happens next
STR-1:

KEY-524885: With [%male#2] returning from his loan at [%team#1-short], are [%person#1-you] planning on unleashing him into the first team?
STR-1:

KEY-524886: Do [%person#1-you] plan to give [%male#2] a chance to impress after recalling him from his loan at [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-524887: [%person#1-surname] ready to unleash [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-524888: [%person#1-surname] set to give [%male#2-surname] chance to impress
STR-1:

KEY-524889: [%person#1-surname] adopts cautious approach with [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-524890: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] is still young
STR-1:

KEY-524891: [%person#1-I] think we should all be prepared to wait and see what happens
STR-1:

KEY-524892: [%person#1-I] think he can bring something different to our squad, so why not? He looks ready
STR-1:

KEY-524893: He's proven himself capable of handling this sort of challenge so [%person#1-I]'m keen to see what he can do for us
STR-1:

KEY-524894: He's earned an opportunity to come back and impress us and [%person#1-I]'m going to give him that
STR-1:

KEY-524895: [%person#1-I]'ve been impressed with what he's done out on loan; now it's time to find out if he's ready for us
STR-1:

KEY-524896: [%person#1-I] definitely want to get a closer look at him but [%person#1-I] wouldn't say he's about to become a first-team regular, not just yet
STR-1:

KEY-524897: We'll be patient and cautious with him, but [%person#1-I] do want to get him involved a little bit more. He deserves it
STR-1:

KEY-524898: Let's not forget that he's still young and his time is yet to come. He'll still benefit from coming back here and continuing his development
STR-1:

KEY-524899: We'll see what happens but [%person#1-I] want to temper everyone's expectations. Training with us will help him make progress anyway
STR-1:

KEY-524900: Do [%person#1-you] have plans to give [%male#2] another chance to impress after recalling him from his loan spell with [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-524901: After [%person#1-you] decided to bring [%male#2] back from [%team#2-short], will he get another chance to earn a place in [%person#1-your] team, a move that would surprise some people?
STR-1:

KEY-524902: [%person#1-surname] wants to give [%male#2-surname] a chance
STR-1:

KEY-524903: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] has a chance to impress
STR-1:

KEY-524904: [%person#1-surname] wants closer look at [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-524905: [%person#1-surname] unsure about [%male#2-surname]{s} future
STR-1:

KEY-524906: [%person#1-I]'m not going to get into that right now
STR-1:

KEY-524907: [%person#1-I] think he's earned a chance to come back in and [%person#1-I] reckon he can add something to the squad that we don't have
STR-1:

KEY-524908: [%person#1-I] like what [%person#1-I]'ve seen from him and it's fair at this time to give him that chance to show what he can do
STR-1:

KEY-524909: He's going to get a chance to show us what sort of player he is now, and [%person#1-I] want him to succeed, because it'll help everyone
STR-1:

KEY-524910: He's worked on his game and made progress and now he gets a chance to impress us
STR-1:

KEY-524911: [%person#1-I] would like to have a closer look at him for sure. We'll see what comes of it
STR-1:

KEY-524912: He's intrigued [%person#1-me] enough to want to take a closer look at him. After that, it's up to him what happens
STR-1:

KEY-524913: [%person#1-I] don't know if he'll suddenly become a first-team regular, but anything's possible really
STR-1:

KEY-524914: To be honest, [%person#1-I]'m really not sure what to expect from him, but it's worth bringing him back to find out what we've got
STR-1:

KEY-524915: Following [%person#1-your] decision to bring [%male#2] back from [%team#2-short], can we expect a permanent move elsewhere to happen?
STR-1:

KEY-524916: Is [%male#2] heading out of [%team#1-short] permanently after [%person#1-you] recalled him from [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-524917: [%person#1-surname] ready to let [%male#2-surname] go
STR-1:

KEY-524918: [%person#1-surname] would consider [%male#2-surname] sale
STR-1:

KEY-524919: [%person#1-surname] has plans for [%male#2-surname] at [%team#1-short]
STR-1:

KEY-524920: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] has [%team#1-short] future
STR-1:

KEY-524921: [%person#1-I] won't be discussing any transfer stories today, sorry
STR-1:

KEY-524922: Yeah, we have a deal lined up for him, so we needed to bring him back in order for that to happen
STR-1:

KEY-524923: [%person#1-I] think so, yes. We're close to finalising a permanent sale and he needed to leave [%team#2-short] for that to happen
STR-1:

KEY-524924: We haven't got anything in place but it's fair to say we've taken this step to make it more of a possibility
STR-1:

KEY-524925: Nothing is imminent but [%person#1-I] wanted to bring him back to make any deal that bit easier
STR-1:

KEY-524926: [%person#1-I] don't have any plans to sell him; in fact, we'd like to see him in the first team here
STR-1:

KEY-524927: On the contrary, [%person#1-I] have plans for him right here at [%team#1-short]
STR-1:

KEY-524928: He has a future in [%person#1-my] team so we certainly won't be selling him
STR-1:

KEY-524929: Not at all. He's not being sold, he's going to be a part of [%person#1-my] plans moving forward
STR-1:

KEY-524930: Call [%person#1-me] cynical if you want but sometimes [%person#1-I] don't think performance has anything to do with transfers. [%person#1-I] see so many transfers of players who have been underperforming [%person#1-I] wonder what people are looking at!
STR-1:

KEY-524931: [%person#1-surname] dislikes technology after [%team#1-short] disappointment
STR-1:

KEY-524932: It doesn't look as bad as we first feared, thankfully, so hopefully he won't be out for very long
STR-1:

KEY-524933: As far as [%person#1-I]'m aware it might not be that bad, and we're very happy about that
STR-1:

KEY-524934: We still need to do further checks but, fingers crossed, it's not that bad
STR-1:

KEY-524935: He still has to undergo a couple of tests but [%person#1-I] think he'll be fine, generally speaking
STR-1:

KEY-524936: It doesn't look good; we'll have to wait and see how long it is
STR-1:

KEY-524937: [%person#1-I]'m afraid it might be a bad one, we're not sure how long, but fingers crossed for the lad
STR-1:

KEY-524938: Yeah, unfortunately it's a bad one, and [%person#1-I]'m gutted for him
STR-1:

KEY-524939: He might be out for a fair while unfortunately, it's the worst part of football
STR-1:

KEY-524940: How big of a blow is it to lose [%male#2] to injury?
STR-1:

KEY-524941: How are [%person#1-you] going to handle being without [%male#2] for a while due to injury?
STR-1:

KEY-524942: We have to use it as motivation to go on and not let it bring us down. [%male#2-first] would hate for that to happen
STR-1:

KEY-524943: [%male#2-first] would be the first person to tell us that the show must go on; we have to use his absence as motivation not to let him or anyone else down
STR-1:

KEY-524944: Anyone would miss a player of his calibre, but we have to be positive, and someone else now has to step up in his absence
STR-1:

KEY-524945: Misfortune creates opportunity and, as much as we'd rather have him available, we have to be positive as we move forward without him
STR-1:

KEY-524946: We'll have to change things up a bit but we're definitely going to miss him
STR-1:

KEY-524947: He's not the sort of player who is easily replaced and we'll have our work cut out to get by while he's out
STR-1:

KEY-524948: We can't replace him, it's as simple as that
STR-1:

KEY-524949: Honestly, [%person#1-I] don't think we can replace him. We've got a lot of work to do
STR-1:

KEY-524950: [%person#1-Your] unbeaten run continues! How long can [%person#1-you] keep this run going?
STR-1:

KEY-524951: How much longer do [%person#1-you] believe this unbeaten run will continue?
STR-1:

KEY-524952: This rich vein of form is seemingly never-ending. How long do [%person#1-you] see the run continuing for?
STR-1:

KEY-524953: [%person#1-Your] team look imperious at the moment and have maintained an impressive unbeaten run. Do [%person#1-you] expect to carry on this form over the coming games?
STR-1:

KEY-524954: The sky is the limit with [%person#1-me] in charge. [%person#1-I] wouldn't say [%person#1-I]'m the best manager in the business but [%person#1-I]'m in the top one
STR-1:

KEY-524955: We have a fantastic group of players and everyone is pulling in the same direction. Those two factors mean we have a great chance of extending this good form
STR-1:

KEY-524956: We're blowing teams out the water currently. We're the sharks in this ocean and [%person#1-I] don't see that changing anytime soon
STR-1:

KEY-524957: Confidence is through the roof at the moment.[%person#1-I]'ve got full faith in this group to keep this run going
STR-1:

KEY-524958: We look ahead game by game but there is no doubting the confidence within this group to continue this form
STR-1:

KEY-524959: [%person#1-I] see the smiles in the dressing room currently and it gives [%person#1-me] belief we're not done yet
STR-1:

KEY-524960: There's an expectation within our team to win every game we go into. That drive and determination encourages [%person#1-me] that we'll extend this streak
STR-1:

KEY-524961: No one has a crystal ball to peer into and tell us our fate, the next result and continuing this run is up to us
STR-1:

KEY-524962: These good times don't last forever, [%person#1-I]'m realistic about that but hopefully we keep it up for a while longer
STR-1:

KEY-524963: Our upcoming opposition means it may be difficult to continue this run but we'll give it our best shot
STR-1:

KEY-524964: It's about managing expectation. [%person#1-I] hope we can continue these performances but we must avoid dropping our heads when this run eventually comes to an end
STR-1:

KEY-524965: One lapse and our run is over. [%person#1-I]'m not ignorant in thinking this will last forever
STR-1:

KEY-524966: Teams are going to view us as a big scalp at the moment. No one wants to see you succeed and we need to be ready to face that challenge head on
STR-1:

KEY-524967: It will only get tougher from here on in. We're prepared to face the best version of every team and pick ourselves back up if things don't go our way
STR-1:

KEY-524968: The end is probably nigh. We know how tough it is to continue to deliver consistently but we'll fight until the end
STR-1:

KEY-524969: We are taking it one game at a time but we know everyone will want to get one over us and end our streak. [%person#1-My] main concern is ensuring morale doesn't drop when that loss eventually arrives
STR-1:

KEY-524970: Are [%person#1-you] worried that some of the [%team#1-short] players might grow complacent because of this good run?
STR-1:

KEY-524971: Considering how well things are going, do [%person#1-you] fear the effects of complacency?
STR-1:

KEY-524972: There's no chance of complacency; it's not in our nature, and we're going to keep this run going for as long as possible
STR-1:

KEY-524973: [%person#1-I]'ve seen nothing that would make [%person#1-me] think we're taking things for granted. This run can last as long as we want it to
STR-1:

KEY-524974: Each result gives us the confidence to extend our run of good form and all [%person#1-I] see in the dressing room is positivity right now
STR-1:

KEY-524975: We always have to remain focused, sure, but [%person#1-I] think we're showing that we are right now. That's the most pleasing thing for [%person#1-me]
STR-1:

KEY-524976: [%person#1-I]'m always wary of losing focus and it's hard to deny that complacency can kick in at times like this. [%person#1-I] have to make sure it doesn't
STR-1:

KEY-524977: We're all aware of the pitfalls of success and [%person#1-I] need to make sure that we're focused squarely on the task at hand
STR-1:

KEY-524978: Oh yeah, for sure, we can't let complacency bring us down. Nobody else can stop us and it'd be a real shame if we brought about our own downfall
STR-1:

KEY-524979: Yeah, we have to focus even harder now, because it won't take much to undo all of our good work during this run
STR-1:

KEY-524980: The referee was busy today, with your side receiving an abundance of cards. Does this aggressive approach concern [%person#1-you]?
STR-1:

KEY-524981: [%person#1-Your] side collected a number of cards today. Are [%person#1-you] concerned by the lack of control displayed by [%person#1-your] team?
STR-1:

KEY-524982: They played for the shirt. [%person#1-I]'ll never criticise [%person#1-my] players for giving 100%
STR-1:

KEY-524983: The game has well and truly gone. There was a day when we'd be applauded for wearing your heart on your sleeve and not shirking a tackle
STR-1:

KEY-524984: We imposed ourselves on the opposition, [%person#1-I] have no concerns about that
STR-1:

KEY-524985: If you are expecting an apology then you've come to the wrong place. [%person#1-I] have no complaints with the way [%person#1-my] team played
STR-1:

KEY-524986: It's not our preferred approach and [%person#1-I] feel [%person#1-my] players got a bit carried away today
STR-1:

KEY-524987: A couple of them need to think about their actions. [%person#1-I]'m as surprised as you by the performance
STR-1:

KEY-524988: It's not the way [%person#1-I] want [%person#1-my] team playing. Risking fines and suspensions is and never will be [%person#1-my] way of playing
STR-1:

KEY-524989: [%person#1-I] think the referee was card-happy today but [%person#1-I] can't excuse some of the tackles. We'll handle it internally but [%person#1-I]'m hoping this is the last time [%person#1-I] have to answer a question on this topic
STR-1:

KEY-524990: A nice debut for [%male#2] today?
STR-1:

KEY-524991: Were [%person#1-you] pleased with [%male#2]{s} debut?
STR-1:

KEY-524992: He was excellent and it can only be good for his future prospects here
STR-1:

KEY-524993: [%person#1-I] couldn't be happier, he was outstanding
STR-1:

KEY-524994: [%person#1-I] thought he did really well and it's a great way for him to introduce himself
STR-1:

KEY-524995: [%person#1-I]'m very pleased and [%person#1-I] hope he is too. It's the right way to get started here
STR-1:

KEY-524996: He was good but it's just one match; we need to temper expectations early on
STR-1:

KEY-524997: It's fine to praise him after a good performance but, while he settles in, we should be cautious to not over-react when he has a quiet day
STR-1:

KEY-524998: That's the standard [%person#1-I] expect, now he has to meet it every week
STR-1:

KEY-524999: [%person#1-I] now know he's capable of that performance. The next challenge is to see how much he can improve
STR-1:

KEY-525000: A nice debut for [%male#2] today as he found the scoresheet. [%person#1-You] must be happy?
STR-1:

KEY-525001: How pleased are [%person#2-you] with [%male#2]{s} goalscoring debut?
STR-1:

KEY-525002: [%person#1-I]'m delighted, it was a brilliant start from him
STR-1:

KEY-525003: [%person#1-I]'m very pleased, but also very happy for him, as it's a great way for him to introduce himself
STR-1:

KEY-525004: It was a very good start and [%person#1-I]'m excited for what's to come
STR-1:

KEY-525005: That's what he's capable of and [%person#1-I]'m pleased he's been able to make such a good start to his career here
STR-1:

KEY-525006: It was a nice start but [%person#1-I] want to be careful that we don't set unrealistic expectations for him as a result
STR-1:

KEY-525007: [%person#1-I] was pleased with his performance but we shouldn't get too excited, it's still very early in his time here, and we need to be patient
STR-1:

KEY-525008: [%person#1-I] hope it's the first of many good performances; that's the challenge he's been set
STR-1:

KEY-525009: The most important thing is for him to build on this debut performance and continue improving
STR-1:

KEY-525010: It's one of those matches that will be talked about for a long time to come, [%person#1-I] think
STR-1:

KEY-525011: [%person#1-I]'m more pleased for the players, they were great and showed everyone what they're capable of
STR-1:

KEY-525012: Any team with their sort of quality will always be in with a chance. [%person#1-I] hope we're prepared
STR-1:

KEY-525013: We can't afford to go into this one anything less than 100% prepared, or we won't win, it's that simple
STR-1:

KEY-525014: We're a pretty good team ourselves and [%person#1-I] know we've got a chance if we play to our usual standards
STR-1:

KEY-525015: Every team we play has quality, but we're a good team too, and [%person#1-I]'m sure they're worried about us
STR-1:

KEY-525016: We'll give them all due respect but [%person#1-I] think we should be winning this match
STR-1:

KEY-525017: [%person#1-I] think we're favourites and deservedly so too
STR-1:

KEY-525018: Who are [%person#1-you] hoping to be drawn against in the next round?
STR-1:

KEY-525019: Do [%person#1-you] have a team [%person#2-you]'d like to face in the next round?
STR-1:

KEY-525020: Who would [%person#1-you] like to see [%team#1-short] drawn against next?
STR-1:

KEY-525021: We're very pleased with his recovery and [%person#1-I] think it's possible he's able to play some part in the match
STR-1:

KEY-525022: He's been making good progress but no decision has been made yet on whether he'll play
STR-1:

KEY-525023: [%person#1-I]'m going to speak to our medical team after this but [%person#1-I]'ve been hearing positive things about his progress
STR-1:

KEY-525024: The game against [%team#2-short] will probably come too soon for him
STR-1:

KEY-525025: He's desperate to play but my feeling is that he'll have to sit this one out
STR-1:

KEY-525026: There's no chance he'll play unfortunately
STR-1:

KEY-525027: Don't hold your breath
STR-1:

KEY-525028: Yeah he'll be involved
STR-1:

KEY-525029: Yep, he's in the squad
STR-1:

KEY-525030: [%person#1-I] think so, yes. He might be a bit tired but aren't we all?
STR-1:

KEY-525031: He should be alright, though we'll have to see how long he can play for
STR-1:

KEY-525032: [%person#1-I]'m not sure to be honest, the travel is a problem, so we'll have to see
STR-1:

KEY-525033: He might be back but we'll have to be careful about playing him because of the travel. It's far from ideal
STR-1:

KEY-525034: No, he's out, he'll be a bit jetlagged and [%person#1-I]'m not really happy about having to play this match without him
STR-1:

KEY-525035: He's going to be too jetlagged to play so we've got some problems. Why are clubs expected to put up with this?
STR-1:

KEY-525036: It's a must-win match, make no mistake about it
STR-1:

KEY-525037: We have to win, it's as simple as that
STR-1:

KEY-525038: We need to make sure we play to our abilities because of what's at stake. We want to stay top
STR-1:

KEY-525039: [%person#1-I] don't want to be chasing, [%person#1-I] want to lead the pack, and that means we have to do whatever it takes to stay on top
STR-1:

KEY-525040: [%person#1-I]'m not really concerned about the fluctuations from game to game, it's all about where we finish at the end of the season
STR-1:

KEY-525041: [%person#1-I] don't get caught up in the detail of each match; the bigger picture is far more important as far as [%person#1-I]'m concerned
STR-1:

KEY-525042: It's just another match as far as [%person#1-I]'m concerned, the narrative around it is for others to enjoy
STR-1:

KEY-525043: We're treating this as just another match, just as we have all season
STR-1:

KEY-525044: How excited are [%person#1-you] to get the new season underway?
STR-1:

KEY-525045: With the opening day fast approaching, how excited are [%person#1-you] for the season ahead?
STR-1:

KEY-525046: [%person#1-I] can't wait, we're itching to get out there, and [%person#1-I]'m excited about the team we're developing into
STR-1:

KEY-525047: [%person#1-I] really can't wait to get going, it's a very exciting time to be at [%team#1-short]
STR-1:

KEY-525048: This is what we've been preparing for and [%person#1-I]'ll be happy to get out there and play real, competitive football
STR-1:

KEY-525049: We've worked hard to get to this point and now [%person#1-I] think we're ready to go
STR-1:

KEY-525050: It's another step in the process for us; we'll continue to work towards our objectives just the same
STR-1:

KEY-525051: [%person#1-I] think it means more to the fans and the pundits than us; we've been preparing hard and that work just continues now
STR-1:

KEY-525052: Truth be told, [%person#1-I]'d rather have had more time to prepare, but that's life
STR-1:

KEY-525053: [%person#1-I] think [%person#1-I]'d have preferred more time to prepare but here we go anyway
STR-1:

KEY-525054: Are [%person#1-you] confident that [%person#1-your] preparations will lead to a good start to the new season?
STR-1:

KEY-525055: There's a real buzz around the squad right now, they're ready to go, and [%person#1-I] believe in their ability
STR-1:

KEY-525056: [%person#1-I] think we're in a good position right now, we're working hard in training, and that can only lead to good things
STR-1:

KEY-525057: [%person#1-I]'m prepared for anything, but it'll be important not to overreact to whatever happens; it's just one match
STR-1:

KEY-525058: [%person#1-I] never know what to expect; we can prepare as well as we think possible but, once the boys are out there playing for real, anything can happen
STR-1:

KEY-525059: Heading into the new season, do [%person#1-you] know [%person#1-your] strongest team?
STR-1:

KEY-525060: Are [%person#1-you] confident on what [%person#1-your] strongest starting eleven looks like following pre-season?
STR-1:

KEY-525061: [%person#1-I] think there's a group that have separated themselves from the pack, but competition is healthy, and that can change from game to game
STR-1:

KEY-525062: [%person#1-I] have a strong core of players to rely on that will make up the majority of the starting team, but it's not set in stone, and those that deserve to play will play
STR-1:

KEY-525063: Every manager thinks they know their best eleven, and [%person#1-I]'m no different, but remember circumstances can change very quickly
STR-1:

KEY-525064: [%person#1-I] have a rough idea of who can be counted on more often than not, but that's not to say they're guaranteed starts no matter what
STR-1:

KEY-525065: There's no such thing as a 'strongest team' in [%person#1-my] mind. We have a squad and every single member of that squad is trusted to perform
STR-1:

KEY-525066: [%person#1-I]'m not the sort of manager to stick to the same team week after week. [%person#1-I] have so many good players and they all deserve to play
STR-1:

KEY-525067: [%person#1-I] know [%person#1-my] team for the opening day, that's all we're focusing on right now
STR-1:

KEY-525068: [%person#1-I]'m the sort of manager who prefers to take things one game at a time, so the idea of a 'strongest eleven' has never worked for [%person#1-me]
STR-1:

KEY-525069: Do [%person#1-you] feel ready for the new season?
STR-1:

KEY-525070: Are [%person#1-you] happy with how the team have prepared for this new season?
STR-1:

KEY-525071: We're ready to go, this is what we've been waiting for and working hard to be prepared for
STR-1:

KEY-525072: [%person#1-I]'m very happy, we're working hard, and we're ready to go
STR-1:

KEY-525073: [%person#1-I]'m happy with what [%person#1-I]'ve seen and now's as good as time as any to get started
STR-1:

KEY-525074: We've planned things well, got a lot of good work into the players, and it's time to get started for real
STR-1:

KEY-525075: [%person#1-I] don't know, we'll only find out how ready we are when we get out there
STR-1:

KEY-525076: The proof of the pudding will be in the eating; we've put in the work but only time will tell how ready we are
STR-1:

KEY-525077: [%person#1-I] think we're up against it and we might not be fully up to speed for a few more weeks
STR-1:

KEY-525078: [%person#1-I] won't lie, you might not see the real [%team#1-short] for a few games yet
STR-1:

KEY-525079: [%person#1-I] think they're in with a chance, they're in good form, and those are the matches title challengers need to win
STR-1:

KEY-525080: [%team#3-short] are a good team and won't roll over for [%team#2-short], that's for sure
STR-1:

KEY-525081: [%person#1-I]'m not so sure, that looks like a really tough challenge for them
STR-1:

KEY-525082: Do [%person#1-you] think [%team#2-short] can beat [%team#3-short] to keep their title hopes alive?
STR-1:

KEY-525083: [%person#1-I] expect them to challenge regardless of what happens in that match. They're definitely a contender
STR-1:

KEY-525084: [%person#1-I] don't see why they can't continue to challenge, they're in good form, and they have to be respected. Don't underestimate them
STR-1:

KEY-525085: [%person#1-I] have [%person#1-my] doubts; they just seem to lack that extra something that title challengers tend to have
STR-1:

KEY-525086: [%person#1-I] can't see it happening; there are too many question marks about them
STR-1:

KEY-525087: How are [%person#1-you] preparing for [%team#2-short] after they suffered something of a surprising defeat to [%team#3-short] last time out?
STR-1:

KEY-525088: Considering [%team#2-short] suffered a surprising defeat to [%team#3-short] in their last match, how are [%person#1-you] preparing for them?
STR-1:

KEY-525089: [%person#1-I] think we need to capitalise on any uncertainty they might be feeling and really take advantage where we can
STR-1:

KEY-525090: They might be doubting themselves a little more as a result of that defeat so we need to try to take advantage as much as possible
STR-1:

KEY-525091: [%person#1-I] think they're a little bit fragile so we need to press home our quality where we can
STR-1:

KEY-525092: If they're feeling a little fragile or uncertain then we can't afford to be hospitable. We need to make life even harder for them
STR-1:

KEY-525093: [%person#1-I] think they'll come out fighting and we have to be ready for that
STR-1:

KEY-525094: [%person#1-I] expect we'll see the real [%team#2-short] and we need to respect the quality they have
STR-1:

KEY-525095: They'll be angry and ready to fight back. They're a very dangerous opponent for us
STR-1:

KEY-525096: [%person#1-I]'m expecting them to be as angry as [%person#1-I]'d be in their position. We're in for a real battle here
STR-1:

KEY-525097: Hopefully, the fans will remember all [%male#2-first] did for the club and give him a generous welcome
STR-1:

KEY-525098: [%person#1-I]'d like him to be given a decent reception ahead of kick-off and then for business as usual to take over
STR-1:

KEY-525099: [%person#1-I] think he served this club well and [%person#1-I]'d like for him to get the reception he deserves
STR-1:

KEY-525100: Whatever reaction he gets, [%person#1-I] can't imagine it'll affect his performance
STR-1:

KEY-525101: He's a pro, he'll play his game regardless of the reception he gets
STR-1:

KEY-525102: He is but one player; the match will be decided by the team that plays best
STR-1:

KEY-525103: [%person#1-I] don't think we should get caught up in the noise around one player; there are many more players involved besides him
STR-1:

KEY-525104: [%person#1-I]'m tired of hearing about it really
STR-1:

KEY-525105: The sooner this circus is over, the better
STR-1:

KEY-525106: How much of a role has [%male#2] played in [%team#2-short]{s} success in [%person#1-your] opinion?
STR-1:

KEY-525107: He's got absolute top quality and any club with a player of his ability is always going to stand a chance of doing very well
STR-1:

KEY-525108: [%person#1-I] don't think it's up for discussion; he's been outstanding
STR-1:

KEY-525109: He's clearly very good but, in [%person#1-my] experience, a team's success is always down to the collective efforts of everyone involved
STR-1:

KEY-525110: Don't get [%person#1-me] wrong, he's a good player, but his contributions maybe haven't quite matched the hype
STR-1:

KEY-525111: Would [%person#1-you] say [%male#2] is [%team#2-short]{s} most important player right now?
STR-1:

KEY-525112: [%person#1-I] think he has an undeniably positive influence on their performances and that's hard to find at any level
STR-1:

KEY-525113: He turns up every week and gives them a better chance of winning. He's a very good player
STR-1:

KEY-525114: He's always front and centre in the best of what they do but it's probably unfair on the rest of his team-mates to single him out for particular praise
STR-1:

KEY-525115: [%person#1-I] wouldn't say he's their best player but then [%person#1-I]'m not their manager
STR-1:

KEY-525116: [%person#1-I]'m not worried about complacency; we should be fine
STR-1:

KEY-525117: It's fine to be cautious but we know our responsibilities and we think we'll do well
STR-1:

KEY-525118: None of us wants to be on the wrong end of a giant-killing so we need to be careful for sure
STR-1:

KEY-525119: It's hard to avoid all the talk around a potential upset and that does add some unwanted pressure. We need to be careful
STR-1:

KEY-525120: We've got nothing to gain and everything to lose in this scenario. It's easy to see why these upsets happen
STR-1:

KEY-525121: Everyone wants to see an upset except for us! We know that's the worst-case scenario and we'll have to work very hard to avoid it
STR-1:

KEY-525122: Does [%person#1-your] confidence translate to [%person#1-your] players? How confident are they?
STR-1:

KEY-525123: Do [%person#1-you] think [%person#1-you] project that very obvious confidence onto [%person#1-your] players?
STR-1:

KEY-525124: We're all confident and we feel we can win every match
STR-1:

KEY-525125: We need to be confident heading into every match. If we don't have that belief, we've lost the battle
STR-1:

KEY-525126: [%person#1-I]'m confident because [%person#1-I] know the work we do. We have to play with that same positivity now
STR-1:

KEY-525127: [%person#1-I] think we can be positive because we know how hard we work. That's the way we operate here
STR-1:

KEY-525128: [%person#1-I] have to make sure every player is in the right state of mind to go and do their jobs. That means being positive as often as possible
STR-1:

KEY-525129: Every player is different and, if [%person#1-I] can help them feel confident through [%person#1-my] actions, that's great
STR-1:

KEY-525130: [%person#1-I]'m naturally confident but the players have to know that doesn't give them the freedom to suddenly become complacent
STR-1:

KEY-525131: There's a fine line between confidence and complacency and we need to tread it carefully
STR-1:

KEY-525132: Are [%person#1-you] out for revenge against [%team#2-short] here?
STR-1:

KEY-525133: How much do [%person#1-you] want to get revenge against [%team#2-short] after the last meeting between the two teams?
STR-1:

KEY-525134: [%person#1-I] can't deny that there's a little extra motivation for us ahead of this match
STR-1:

KEY-525135: We all have the desire to make amends and right some wrongs, of course, that's human nature
STR-1:

KEY-525136: [%person#1-I]'m looking for a positive reaction and, if we get that, [%person#1-I] fancy our chances
STR-1:

KEY-525137: [%person#1-I] think a few of the players are definitely using what happened last time as fuel for their fires, yeah
STR-1:

KEY-525138: [%person#1-I]'m not motivated so much by revenge, [%person#1-I] just want to win
STR-1:

KEY-525139: As long as we win, you can all attribute it to whatever you want!
STR-1:

KEY-525140: [%person#1-I] don't want us to get lost in the narrative. We have a job to do and [%person#1-I] expect us to do it professionally
STR-1:

KEY-525141: As far as [%person#1-I]'m concerned, it's just another match. We need to stay focused
STR-1:

KEY-525142: [%person#1-I] have enormous respect for [%person#2-him] and we always enjoying facing each other
STR-1:

KEY-525143: [%person#2-first] is a friend first, opponent second. [%person#1-I]'m looking forward to catching up with [%person#2-him] after the game
STR-1:

KEY-525144: [%person#2-first] is someone [%person#1-I]'ve learned lots from. We still speak often
STR-1:

KEY-525145: [%person#2-first] is admired by everyone and rightly so. [%person#1-I]'m honoured to call [%person#2-him] a friend off the pitch
STR-1:

KEY-525146: [%person#2-He]'s someone [%person#1-I] trust completely and our friendship resonates around sharing a similar philosophy
STR-1:

KEY-525147: [%person#1-I]'ve had the privilege to know [%person#2-him] as a person and a coach. He's someone who is admired throughout football
STR-1:

KEY-525148: [%person#1-My] admiration for [%person#2-first] is sky-high. [%person#1-I] always wish [%person#2-him] well when we're not competing against each other
STR-1:

KEY-525149: We've become good friends and [%person#1-I] always look forward to seeing [%person#2-first]
STR-1:

KEY-525150: We don't enjoy much of a relationship outside of the mutual respect you see on the touchline
STR-1:

KEY-525151: There's a level of respect between us but that's as far as it goes
STR-1:

KEY-525152: [%person#2-He]'s not someone [%person#1-I]'m in contact with much outside of our matches
STR-1:

KEY-525153: There's no animosity between us but [%person#1-I] haven't forged any kind of friendship with [%person#2-him]
STR-1:

KEY-525154: [%person#1-I]'d cross the street to avoid [%person#2-him]. That's all [%person#1-I]'ll say
STR-1:

KEY-525155: [%person#1-I] associate myself with winners. [%person#2-He]'s a specialist in failure in [%person#1-my] eyes
STR-1:

KEY-525156: [%person#2-He]'s not someone who interests me. He doesn't matter to me at all
STR-1:

KEY-525157: [%person#2-He]'s not my cup of tea. [%person#1-I] don't actually like tea but if [%person#1-I] did [%person#1-I] imagine [%person#2-his] kind of tea would leave a very bitter taste in your mouth
STR-1:

KEY-525158: What's the state of [%person#1-your] relationship with [%job#2] [%person#2]?
STR-1:

KEY-525159: [%person#1-I] get on brilliantly with [%person#2-first] and we both want the very best for this club
STR-1:

KEY-525160: We share the same long-term vision and continue to work hard to achieve our objectives. [%person#2-He]'s great to work with
STR-1:

KEY-525161: We don't always agree, but it's all built on a solid professional relationship, and that's how it should be
STR-1:

KEY-525162: [%person#1-I]'m not going to give anyone a juicy quote or anything here but [%person#1-I] think it's clear when we do and don't get along
STR-1:

KEY-525163: [%person#1-You]'ve sprung no surprises with [%person#1-your] team selection; can [%person#1-you] get a result?
STR-1:

KEY-525164: With no surprises in [%person#1-your] team news, [%person#1-you] must be feeling confident?
STR-1:

KEY-525165: We're always confident; we've prepared well and now we have to do our jobs
STR-1:

KEY-525166: [%person#1-I] always have confidence in [%person#1-my] players and we're looking forward to this one
STR-1:

KEY-525167: [%person#1-I] think we've got a good chance but we need to start with intensity and go from there
STR-1:

KEY-525168: [%person#1-I] like our chances but it's imperative that we start well, we can't afford to play catch-up here
STR-1:

KEY-525169: They're a good team and we're going to have to be at our best if we're to get a result
STR-1:

KEY-525170: Make no mistake about it, this is a really tough game, and it might be settled late on such is the way these matches go
STR-1:

KEY-525171: [%person#1-I] think the pressure is all on [%team#2-short] so we'll just try to enjoy ourselves
STR-1:

KEY-525172: [%person#1-I] don't think the pressure is on us to get a result here, it's on [%team#2-short], so we can play with some freedom
STR-1:

KEY-525173: What's the reason behind [%male#2]{s} absence?
STR-1:

KEY-525174: It's just a selection decision, nothing else
STR-1:

KEY-525175: [%person#1-I] don't think he trained that well this week and we needed a bit more impetus in the team
STR-1:

KEY-525176: He's rested, that's all
STR-1:

KEY-525177: [%person#1-I]'ve got a squad of players to choose from and to keep happy, it's simple rotation
STR-1:

KEY-525178: Does [%male#2] miss out because of his recent injury layoff?
STR-1:

KEY-525179: Have his recent injuries affected [%male#2] to the point he's not involved today?
STR-1:

KEY-525180: Yep, he's short of fitness, so we're not prepared to take any risks
STR-1:

KEY-525181: He needs a bit of time to get back to proper match fitness so we need to manage him accordingly
STR-1:

KEY-525182: We'd probably risk him if we had to but, as we don't, we won't
STR-1:

KEY-525183: If we were absolutely desperate then he'd play, but we'll play it safe while we can, and make sure we get him back to full fitness
STR-1:

KEY-525184: No, he's just being rested
STR-1:

KEY-525185: He's being rested, there are no injury concerns
STR-1:

KEY-525186: It's a selection decision; the only problem he has is that [%person#1-I] can't pick everyone
STR-1:

KEY-525187: It's a technical decision, no injuries, nothing else
STR-1:

KEY-525188: [%team#2-short] are without [%male#2] today; how big of a help is that?
STR-1:

KEY-525189: Do [%person#1-you] think [%male#2]{s} absence makes [%person#1-your] team favourites to win?
STR-1:

KEY-525190: [%person#1-I] think it helps us but it doesn't suddenly mean we're going to saunter to victory
STR-1:

KEY-525191: Any time one of our opponents is without a key player it helps us, but we're not going to assume that we're going to win because of it
STR-1:

KEY-525192: They're still a very good team as far as [%person#1-I]'m concerned; this doesn't change too much
STR-1:

KEY-525193: [%person#1-I] think they'll miss him, but they've got a good squad, and we'll have our work cut out
STR-1:

KEY-525194: It's a team game and [%person#1-I]'m sure the eleven players they start with will be more than good enough to give us a game
STR-1:

KEY-525195: One player doesn't make a team; [%person#1-I]'m sure they'll miss him but they've got a lot of good talent there
STR-1:

KEY-525196: His absence could have a galvanising effect on the rest of the team, and they're the ones who have to go out and play
STR-1:

KEY-525197: Can we talk about the players who will be out there? They're the important ones
STR-1:

KEY-525198: As [%male#2] looks set to make his [%number#1-nth] league appearance for the club, what does he mean to [%team#1-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-525199: He means everything, he represents the very best of [%team#1-short], and [%person#1-I]'m delighted for him
STR-1:

KEY-525200: It's a fantastic achievement by a fantastic player and person. He should be very proud
STR-1:

KEY-525201: That's a question for him; [%person#1-I]'m really just focusing on winning what is going to be a really tough match
STR-1:

KEY-525202: [%person#1-I] have to admit that [%person#1-I] wasn't aware of that! That's what happens when [%person#1-I]'m engrossed in preparing for a match
STR-1:

KEY-525203: Does leaving [%male#2] out of [%person#1-your] starting eleven mean [%person#1-you]'re taking this competition less seriously?
STR-1:

KEY-525204: Can we infer from [%person#1-your] decision not to pick [%male#2] that [%person#1-you] don't care quite as much about how [%team#1-short] fare in this competition?
STR-1:

KEY-525205: [%person#1-I] want to see what the whole squad has to offer and this is a great chance to rotate
STR-1:

KEY-525206: We take every match seriously and [%person#1-I] think the players who are going to play here give us a really good chance of winning while getting the chance to impress [%person#1-me]
STR-1:

KEY-525207: We have to rotate the squad and nobody escapes that
STR-1:

KEY-525208: [%person#1-I]'m definitely taking it seriously but [%person#1-I] also have to rotate the squad and manage the fixture list accordingly
STR-1:

KEY-525209: We have big ambitions here and, if that means changing the team like this from time to time, so be it
STR-1:

KEY-525210: The demands of a season competing on multiple fronts, with some bigger objectives up ahead, mean that the team will sometimes look like this
STR-1:

KEY-525211: [%person#1-I]'m paid to make the tough decisions and that means playing this sort of team for this match
STR-1:

KEY-525212: If people want to call it a weakened team, [%person#1-I] won't complain, but [%person#1-I] know what we're capable of
STR-1:

KEY-525213: How will today's weather conditions affect the match?
STR-1:

KEY-525214: The weather out there is less than ideal. How will that affect the match?
STR-1:

KEY-525215: The weather is the same for both teams so we'll get on with it and not use it as an excuse
STR-1:

KEY-525216: They're not too bad actually, we'll be able to play our game
STR-1:

KEY-525217: We're flexible and adaptable and [%person#1-I] expect us to play to our standards
STR-1:

KEY-525218: [%person#1-I] think we're the sort of team that can handle anything thrown at us
STR-1:

KEY-525219: It's not the best weather to play in but we'll have to deal with it
STR-1:

KEY-525220: It sort of ruins the match as a spectacle and [%person#1-I] don't think it's going to be easy for either team
STR-1:

KEY-525221: [%person#1-I] think the conditions favour them more than they do us, put it that way
STR-1:

KEY-525222: [%person#1-I]'m a little bit worried to be honest, this isn't what we prepared for
STR-1:

KEY-525223: Both teams carry some good recent form into this match. How confident are [%person#1-you]?
STR-1:

KEY-525224: How do [%person#1-you] approach this match with both teams in good form ahead of kick-off?
STR-1:

KEY-525225: [%person#1-I]'m looking forward to it; we have to show our quality and believe that we're the better team
STR-1:

KEY-525226: It's going to be a great match and [%person#1-I] think we need to go in with the confidence to show we're better than they are
STR-1:

KEY-525227: It's a big challenge but hopefully one we're up for
STR-1:

KEY-525228: We have a really good opportunity here to show everyone that we're up for the challenge and [%person#1-I]'m relishing it
STR-1:

KEY-525229: They're a very good team in excellent form and we're going to have to work very, very hard to get something here
STR-1:

KEY-525230: [%person#1-I]'m anticipating a real struggle; we know how good they are and what it's going to take for us to get something
STR-1:

KEY-525231: [%person#1-I]'ve not been all that happy with our performances despite the results and, unless we step things up here, we'll be made to pay
STR-1:

KEY-525232: We've been getting results without playing that well; if we don't improve here, we're going to struggle
STR-1:

KEY-525233: [%person#1-You]'re in much better form than [%team#2-short]; do [%person#1-you] have to be wary of complacency?
STR-1:

KEY-525234: How guarded do [%person#1-you] have to be about complacency considering the differing form between these two teams?
STR-1:

KEY-525235: We're always fully focused on the task at hand so [%person#1-I]'m not really worried
STR-1:

KEY-525236: [%person#1-I]'ve seen nothing to suggest we're taking this for granted, so we should go out there and show our quality
STR-1:

KEY-525237: [%person#1-I] don't think we'll be complacent, but it will be interesting, and we'll have to make sure we seize the initiative
STR-1:

KEY-525238: [%person#1-I]'m not worried about complacency at all, although there's a challenge for us to overcome, and it's one [%person#1-I] think we're up for
STR-1:

KEY-525239: Form goes out of the window sometimes and [%person#1-I]'m certainly expecting [%team#2-short] to make life really hard for us
STR-1:

KEY-525240: [%person#1-I] don't pay any attention to form; they're a good team and we're going to have to work hard for a result
STR-1:

KEY-525241: [%person#1-I] think any manager would be worried about complacency for a match like this. It's [%person#1-my] job to ensure that doesn't happen
STR-1:

KEY-525242: [%person#1-I]'m sure one or two players would like to take it easy here but [%person#1-I] have to make sure they stay focused throughout
STR-1:

KEY-525243: Are [%person#1-you] excited by the prospect of derby day and facing off against [%person#1-your] local rivals?
STR-1:

KEY-525244: These are the occasions we live for as fans, players and managers, and [%person#1-I] can't wait for kick-off. We're confident and ready
STR-1:

KEY-525245: [%person#1-I] tend to enjoy these matches more than most and [%person#1-I] think the players really relish them too, there's an energy that you don't get in other matches
STR-1:

KEY-525246: [%person#1-I] wouldn't say [%person#1-I] enjoy them because they're unpredictable; anything can and usually does happen
STR-1:

KEY-525247: [%person#1-I]'m not the biggest fan of these matches but, more than anything, [%person#1-I] really don't want to disappoint the fans
STR-1:

KEY-525248: It's the game you mark down on your calendar at the start of the season. Everyone is excited and we're confident of getting a positive result
STR-1:

KEY-525249: You can feel the atmosphere this contest creates. We're confident we can deliver and send our fans home with the bragging rights
STR-1:

KEY-525250: [%person#1-I]'ve had one eye on this fixture for a while. It's an honour to lead this club and [%person#1-I]'m optimistic about our chances today
STR-1:

KEY-525251: The dressing room are chomping at the bit to settle some scores out there. We've prepared well and [%person#1-I] believe we'll give a good account of ourselves
STR-1:

KEY-525252: Days like today can make or break a player's career at this football club. [%person#1-I]'m hoping they can deal with the pressure that comes with an occasion like this
STR-1:

KEY-525253: My mood will depend on our performance. [%person#1-I]'ve told my players to enjoy the game but to enjoy it by being disciplined
STR-1:

KEY-525254: There's a lot of responsibility on my shoulders today. [%person#1-I] just hope my team deliver a performance befitting of these fans
STR-1:

KEY-525255: [%person#1-I]'m excited but the worry is always there in these fixtures. A defeat could be catastrophic to our morale
STR-1:

KEY-525256: What makes [%male#2] such a good leader?
STR-1:

KEY-525257: [%male#2] captains the team today; what characteristics make him stand out as a good leader?
STR-1:

KEY-525258: People gravitate to him and look for guidance. He's more than happy to oblige and he's a great character
STR-1:

KEY-525259: He has such a strength of resolve and character, he's a true leader
STR-1:

KEY-525260: [%person#1-I] can rely on him and trust him completely. That's rare in football
STR-1:

KEY-525261: If [%person#1-I] say he's reliable it sounds like [%person#1-I]'m doing him a disservice but [%person#1-I] mean it; he's an absolute guarantee out there on the pitch
STR-1:

KEY-525262: [%person#1-I] think there's a really strong leader in him and [%person#1-I] want to bring that out more by giving him the captaincy
STR-1:

KEY-525263: He's shown me that he can lead, but he needs to be encouraged a bit, so that's what [%person#1-I]'m trying to do here
STR-1:

KEY-525264: [%person#1-I] think there's a lot more to come from him and asking him to lead the team is a part of that challenge
STR-1:

KEY-525265: [%person#1-I] want everyone to improve as much as they can and giving him the captaincy is a challenge [%person#1-I] hope he meets
STR-1:

KEY-525266: What does it mean to [%person#1-you] to be just moments away from [%person#1-your] first match as [%team#1-short] manager?
STR-1:

KEY-525267: How excited are [%person#1-you] right now, on the verge of [%person#1-your] first match as [%team#1-short] manager?
STR-1:

KEY-525268: [%person#1-I]'m very lucky and very excited, let's get started!
STR-1:

KEY-525269: It really means a lot to [%person#1-me] and [%person#1-I] can't wait for that first whistle
STR-1:

KEY-525270: [%person#1-I]'ve had a lot of time to get [%person#1-myself] ready for this and [%person#1-I] just want to get started now
STR-1:

KEY-525271: This opportunity is one [%person#1-I] want to take with both hands and [%person#1-I]'m ready to get stuck in
STR-1:

KEY-525272: [%person#1-I] can feel the excitement around the team but [%person#1-I] want to stress patience and understanding as we go on this journey together
STR-1:

KEY-525273: It's the first chapter of a new story. How that story ends, we won't know for a long time, but it's time to start
STR-1:

KEY-525274: [%person#1-I]'m a little nervous, understandably, but [%person#1-I]'ll be out there doing what [%person#1-I] love soon enough
STR-1:

KEY-525275: There are a few little nerves but [%person#1-I] expect that, it means [%person#1-I]'m alive!
STR-1:

KEY-525276: It's the big one; will [%person#1-you] win the [%comp#1-short] here today?
STR-1:

KEY-525277: Here we go then; are [%person#1-you] going to be crowned [%comp#1-short] winners here today?
STR-1:

KEY-525278: We're going out there with every intention of coming back as winners
STR-1:

KEY-525279: [%person#1-I] think we're ready, everyone's confident, and it's time to go and show what we can do
STR-1:

KEY-525280: We've put ourselves in a good position and [%person#1-I] want us to have fun now
STR-1:

KEY-525281: [%person#1-I] certainly hope so; we deserve to be in this position and now it's time to finish the job
STR-1:

KEY-525282: We'll find out whether we're contenders or pretenders, that's for sure. It's all in our hands
STR-1:

KEY-525283: [%person#1-I]'ve told the team it's up to them now; the time for talking is over, let's go and play
STR-1:

KEY-525284: Win or lose, we've done so well to be here, and whatever happens now doesn't change that
STR-1:

KEY-525285: [%person#1-I] know there has to be a losing team too and, if that's us, we know how well we've done so far
STR-1:

KEY-525286: [%person#1-Your] fate lies in [%person#1-your] hands; can [%person#1-you] win the [%comp#1-short] title?
STR-1:

KEY-525287: The [%comp#1-short] title chances are in [%person#1-your] hands. Can [%team#1-short] go on to become champions?
STR-1:

KEY-525288: That's the aim and that's what we'll be working hard to make happen
STR-1:

KEY-525289: We're focused on our objectives and hopefully we'll get to celebrate at the end of the season
STR-1:

KEY-525290: We've put ourselves in a good position and [%person#1-I] hope we go on and make the most of it
STR-1:

KEY-525291: We've done well so far and [%person#1-I] really hope we can kick on and really finish the season in memorable fashion
STR-1:

KEY-525292: We're going to find out what we're made of. This is where the real work begins
STR-1:

KEY-525293: Only time will tell what we're capable of. This is where we find out whether we're contenders or pretenders
STR-1:

KEY-525294: [%person#1-I] can only see what might go wrong and it drives [%person#1-me] to work even harder to make sure that doesn't happen
STR-1:

KEY-525295: [%person#1-I] honestly don't know if we've got what it takes to get over the line but we'll give it everything
STR-1:

KEY-525296: Are [%person#1-you] concerned about how to stop the in-form [%male#2]?
STR-1:

KEY-525297: Given the way he's been playing, is shutting [%male#2] down a priority for [%person#1-you]?
STR-1:

KEY-525298: [%person#1-I]'m focused on [%person#1-my] team against their team. If we all do our jobs then individuals are taken care of
STR-1:

KEY-525299: [%person#1-I] don't really concern [%person#1-myself] with stopping just one player. We're confident we can take care of business
STR-1:

KEY-525300: We all know what a good player he is and we have something of a plan to try to limit his influence
STR-1:

KEY-525301: [%person#1-I] think everyone respects what a quality player he is and he's definitely someone we'll have to account for
STR-1:

KEY-525302: [%person#1-I]'m not sure he's the sort of player anyone can truly shut down, but we'll give it a go
STR-1:

KEY-525303: [%person#1-I]'m not fooling [%person#1-myself] into thinking we can completely sideline him from the contest, but if we can minimalise his effectiveness, that'll be good
STR-1:

KEY-525304: Let's hope he has an off day!
STR-1:

KEY-525305: [%person#1-I]'d appreciate it if he has a rare off day!
STR-1:

KEY-525306: How do [%person#1-you] solve a problem like [%male#2]?
STR-1:

KEY-525307: Considering how well [%male#2] has played for [%team#2-short] recently, do [%person#1-you] have a plan to get the better of him?
STR-1:

KEY-525308: We're focused on our game plan and, if we play the way we know we can, we'll cause problems for anyone
STR-1:

KEY-525309: We know what we're capable of and so, if we play as we know we can, we're confident we can cause him and the rest of the [%team#2-short] players some problems
STR-1:

KEY-525310: We need to unsettle him and give him something to think about. We can't let him be comfortable
STR-1:

KEY-525311: It's important that we don't let him settle and instead make life as uncomfortable as possible for him
STR-1:

KEY-525312: As good as he is, he has a mistake in him; everyone does. We need to capitalise and give ourselves a chance
STR-1:

KEY-525313: He's not infallible and, if we can force a mistake or two, we then need to take advantage
STR-1:

KEY-525314: We'll give it our best as always but, if he has another game, we'll have to hold our hands up and give him the credit he deserves
STR-1:

KEY-525315: It certainly won't be easy to find a way past him. He's a quality player and he'll make life very hard for us
STR-1:

KEY-525316: How do [%person#1-you] plan to solve [%male#2], who has looked almost unbeatable in goal of late?
STR-1:

KEY-525317: Are [%person#1-you] confident of succeeding where so many have failed in getting the better of [%male#2] in the [%team#2-short] goal?
STR-1:

KEY-525318: Nobody's perfect, him included, and we think we've got a chance to expose one or two of his flaws
STR-1:

KEY-525319: We're confident we can expose his weaknesses, such that they are, and enjoy some success
STR-1:

KEY-525320: We need to unsettle him and make him feel uncomfortable. That's the key for [%person#1-me]
STR-1:

KEY-525321: It's important that we try to unsettle him and not let him find the comfort level he's been playing at recently
STR-1:

KEY-525322: We have to try to force, or more likely hope for, a mistake or two
STR-1:

KEY-525323: Everyone makes mistakes so, hopefully, he drops one or two for us
STR-1:

KEY-525324: We'll play our game and, if we can't get the better of him, we'll congratulate him
STR-1:

KEY-525325: He's really, really good, and if we can't get the better of him, we'll be in good company
STR-1:

KEY-525326: Does being the [%comp#1-short]{s} leading goalscorers give [%person#1-you] confidence that [%person#1-you]'re always going to be in with a chance of winning?
STR-1:

KEY-525327: Goals win matches, pure and simple. It's our job to put the ball in the back of the net and that's what we want to do
STR-1:

KEY-525328: [%person#1-I] like to play attacking football and it's important that we continue to do that
STR-1:

KEY-525329: Goals are good, and important, but we have to have a balance with our defence too. That's how we'll be successful long-term
STR-1:

KEY-525330: [%person#1-I] don't want people thinking we don't value defending or that we don't have good players in those areas. We do!
STR-1:

KEY-525331: [%person#1-You] must be confident of a win considering [%team#2-short] are the lowest goalscorers in the [%comp#1-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-525332: Do [%team#2-short]{s} struggles in front of goal give [%person#1-you] reason to be confidence here?
STR-1:

KEY-525333: [%person#1-I]'m very confident. We should win and [%person#1-I] expect us to show our quality
STR-1:

KEY-525334: [%person#1-I]'m only focused on what we can do but, yes, [%person#1-I] think we've got a great chance
STR-1:

KEY-525335: [%person#1-I] think we have an opportunity to really impress and show everyone what we're capable of, so that's what we'll try to do
STR-1:

KEY-525336: [%person#1-I] mean no disrespect to [%team#2-short] but this match really is a chance for us to make a statement to everyone else about how good we are
STR-1:

KEY-525337: [%person#1-I]'d never dare to disrespect a team of their quality; whatever their issues have been, they're very capable of beating us
STR-1:

KEY-525338: They're a very good team and we cannot afford to be complacent about our chances
STR-1:

KEY-525339: Form is temporary but class is permanent; they're a good team and we can't assume we've won before we've even kicked a ball
STR-1:

KEY-525340: [%person#1-I] wouldn't be so quick as to write them off. They're a good team and they'll pose us problems
STR-1:

KEY-525341: Does [%person#1-your] defensive record - the best in the [%comp#1-short] - give [%person#1-you] confidence going into every match right now?
STR-1:

KEY-525342: [%person#1-I] always say that goals win matches but clean sheets win titles. That's our focus and our defence is the foundation of everything we do
STR-1:

KEY-525343: [%person#1-I]'m very proud of the whole team, because the defensive record relies on everyone doing their part, and we'll keep working hard to improve too
STR-1:

KEY-525344: Every manager wants their team to be secure defensively, but it's not really something we dedicate a lot of time to. We want a real balance at both ends
STR-1:

KEY-525345: [%person#1-I] fear we'll get a reputation for being defensive now! We like to attack and score goals but, if we can keep them out too, [%person#1-I]'ll be very happy
STR-1:

KEY-525346: Does being unbeaten in [%number#1] matches against [%team#2-short] give [%person#1-your] team confidence ahead of this one?
STR-1:

KEY-525347: [%person#1-You] must be confident going into this match considering [%team#1-short] are unbeaten in [%number#1] matches against [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-525348: That sort of run helps because none of us want to be the team that lets the side down; we all want to extend it
STR-1:

KEY-525349: There's motivation in aiming to keep that run going as much as anything else. It all helps
STR-1:

KEY-525350: There's a psychological aspect to it as well; we want to keep the run going to give ourselves an even better chance
STR-1:

KEY-525351: All of us want to make sure we continue to dominate them because it helps keep our confidence high, and drives theirs even lower
STR-1:

KEY-525352: [%person#1-I] don't really pay much attention to it; everything changes over time and we have to view this as a match in a vacuum
STR-1:

KEY-525353: That stuff is more for the media and the fans; [%person#1-I] can't afford to get drawn into it and instead have to make sure we're focused on the task at hand
STR-1:

KEY-525354: The run doesn't matter. All that does matter is what we're going to do in this match, and we have to be prepared
STR-1:

KEY-525355: The past is the past; we're firmly focused on the future, nothing else
STR-1:

KEY-525356: When two so similar teams like this play against each other, what'll make the difference?
STR-1:

KEY-525357: What sort of edge are [%person#1-you] looking for in a match between two teams who are very close in styles?
STR-1:

KEY-525358: It comes down to quality of execution. We need to do everything right if we're to win
STR-1:

KEY-525359: For [%person#1-me] it's all about execution. Whoever does their job the best wins
STR-1:

KEY-525360: It'll be a real battle and [%person#1-I] think it'll come down to who adjusts to small things the best
STR-1:

KEY-525361: It'll be the fine margins that decide this one; if we're to outduel them we need to be 100% focused in every area
STR-1:

KEY-525362: Neither team can afford to make a mistake. The first to blink will regret it
STR-1:

KEY-525363: Whichever team blinks first will probably suffer for it. That's how close it'll be
STR-1:

KEY-525364: Just like anything, luck will undoubtedly play a part
STR-1:

KEY-525365: [%person#1-I]'m sure there'll be no small amount of luck required for whoever goes on to win
STR-1:

KEY-525366: What are [%person#1-you] going to do to stop [%male#2]?
STR-1:

KEY-525367: Given [%male#2]{s} prolific [%comp#1-short] campaign, have [%person#1-you] got something in store to slow him down?
STR-1:

KEY-525368: We have good players too and [%person#1-I]'m confident we can execute our game plan properly
STR-1:

KEY-525369: He's a good player, but [%person#1-I] have good players too, and [%person#1-I] believe in them
STR-1:

KEY-525370: He's obviously someone we've paid close attention to and we'll have to be really sharp to make sure we don't let him enjoy too much success
STR-1:

KEY-525371: It goes without saying that we want to minimalise his impact and [%person#1-I] hope we're in a position to do that
STR-1:

KEY-525372: It's hard to completely silence a player of his quality so we'll need a bit of luck too
STR-1:

KEY-525373: We'll do what we can but we'll also have to hope things don't quite go his way
STR-1:

KEY-525374: [%person#1-I] know all too well how dangerous he is and we'll just have to close our eyes and hope for the best!
STR-1:

KEY-525375: [%person#1-I] hope he has an off day to be honest! That'd be a great help
STR-1:

KEY-525376: How do [%person#1-you] approach a match against a team that values possession as much as [%person#1-you] do?
STR-1:

KEY-525377: What sort of challenges do [%person#1-you] face when coming up against teams like [%team#2-short], who seem to enjoy possession as much as [%team#1-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-525378: We're not going to change what we do, so it's about having the confidence that we do what we do better than them
STR-1:

KEY-525379: [%person#1-I] think we're confident in our own abilities and, when it comes down to it, we know we're capable of overcoming any challenge
STR-1:

KEY-525380: It's going to be fascinating and [%person#1-I] think it might come down to which team manages to make in-game adjustments quicker and better
STR-1:

KEY-525381: It'll come down to the fine margins, like who manages to make subtle adjustments during the course of the match
STR-1:

KEY-525382: We need to stop them doing what they want to do while making sure we play our own game
STR-1:

KEY-525383: We need to be disruptive and make sure they're not able to settle into a position where they can start to play their football
STR-1:

KEY-525384: To be honest it'll probably all come down to luck at the end of the day
STR-1:

KEY-525385: It's not lost on [%person#1-me] how much of a part luck might play; the break of the ball could genuinely settle this match
STR-1:

KEY-525386: [%person#1-Your] team enjoys a lot of possession while [%team#2-short] do not. Are [%person#1-you] ready for them to sit back and challenge [%person#1-your] team to break them down?
STR-1:

KEY-525387: How do [%person#1-you] feel about trying to break down [%team#2-short], a team famed for not favouring possession-based football, in stark contrast to [%person#1-your] own approach?
STR-1:

KEY-525388: We're ready, we know what to expect, and we're going to enjoy trying to win this
STR-1:

KEY-525389: They're not going to surprise us or do anything unexpected, so we're ready for the challenge, and we're confident in our ability
STR-1:

KEY-525390: It's going to be a fascinating match, as it always is when two distinct styles clash, and [%person#1-I]'m hopeful we can find an edge to help us win
STR-1:

KEY-525391: We both do what we do very well, so it's mostly about who finds that decisive edge, and hopefully that'll be us
STR-1:

KEY-525392: It'll be awkward, it might not be pretty to watch, but we'll give it our best
STR-1:

KEY-525393: [%person#1-I]'m not expecting this to be a classic for anyone watching; it'll be an awkward fight, but one we're going to try to win
STR-1:

KEY-525394: We'll take a win however it comes, even if it gets ugly
STR-1:

KEY-525395: [%person#1-I]'ll take an ugly win if necessary, they all count
STR-1:

KEY-525396: Are [%person#1-you] more confident in the knowledge that [%team#1-short] sit [%number#1-nth] in the [%comp#1-short] form table?
STR-1:

KEY-525397: [%team#1-short] have been flying of late and sit [%number#1-nth] in the [%comp#1-short] form table. Does that instil confidence in the squad?
STR-1:

KEY-525398: Momentum is maybe the most valuable asset in football and we hope to keep this run going for as long as we can
STR-1:

KEY-525399: There's a real value in momentum and consistency and [%person#1-I] want to keep this run going for as long as possible
STR-1:

KEY-525400: Every manager wants to enjoy good form and [%person#1-I]'m no different
STR-1:

KEY-525401: If we can keep this going then [%person#1-I]'ll be very happy. Keep it going!
STR-1:

KEY-525402: As good as we're doing right now, we have to guard against complacency. We have to stay focused
STR-1:

KEY-525403: We can't afford to let all of our good work go to waste by growing complacent. It's more important than ever to focus
STR-1:

KEY-525404: [%person#1-I] don't pay too much attention to that; [%person#1-my] focus is on taking things one match at a time
STR-1:

KEY-525405: [%person#1-I] try not to get too high or too low with each result. That's the best way to manage in [%person#1-my] opinion
STR-1:

KEY-525406: [%team#2-short] have been on a good run recently and find themselves [%number#1-nth] in the [%comp#1-short] form table. Are [%person#1-you] in for a tough match here?
STR-1:

KEY-525407: Whether they're in form or not doesn't take anything away from the ability they have in their squad. We believe in ourselves though
STR-1:

KEY-525408: [%person#1-I] think it's the sort of match we all enjoy, two good teams going head-to-head, it's what football is all about
STR-1:

KEY-525409: They're playing with confidence and belief and we're going to have our work cut out to get a result
STR-1:

KEY-525410: [%person#1-I]'m under no illusions about how tricky this match is going to be. They're a very good team and they're playing extremely well
STR-1:

KEY-525411: With [%team#2-short] struggling lately, are [%person#1-you] confident of a comfortable win here?
STR-1:

KEY-525412: Do [%person#1-you] look at this match as an opportunity to take advantage of {an}[%team#2-short] team struggling for form?
STR-1:

KEY-525413: For sure, we always need to make the most of any advantage and they'd do the same to us given the chance
STR-1:

KEY-525414: [%person#1-I] think we need to get on the front foot early and seize the initiative. They're not in the best of form so we have to make the most of that
STR-1:

KEY-525415: We should beat them, that's what the form book will tell you, but we have to make sure we go about our business in a professional manner
STR-1:

KEY-525416: [%person#1-I] think the stats will tell you that we should beat them, but we have to make sure we work hard to make it happen
STR-1:

KEY-525417: Form is temporary but class is permanent; we can't take anything for granted
STR-1:

KEY-525418: Don't write them off, they're a good team, and we won't take them lightly
STR-1:

KEY-525419: [%person#1-I] think they'll make life very hard for us and we have to respect their quality
STR-1:

KEY-525420: Any team playing at this level has the ability to make life hard for us and [%person#1-I]'m expecting nothing less than that
STR-1:

KEY-525421: Do [%person#1-you] think [%male#2] will struggle today as some pundits do?
STR-1:

KEY-525422: What are [%person#1-your] thoughts on speculation that [%male#2] will struggle to perform today?
STR-1:

KEY-525423: [%person#1-I] don't listen to any of that nonsense. [%person#1-I] know [%person#1-my] players and he'll be fine
STR-1:

KEY-525424: [%person#1-I] have full confidence and belief in all of [%person#1-my] players; we don't pay attention to the rent-a-quote brigade
STR-1:

KEY-525425: He has [%person#1-my] trust and that's all that matters
STR-1:

KEY-525426: Every player in [%person#1-my] squad has [%person#1-my] complete trust, end of
STR-1:

KEY-525427: [%person#1-I] can see where they're coming from, but we'll make do, and see how it goes
STR-1:

KEY-525428: [%person#1-I] think we have to make do with what we've got; he's a good footballer, he'll give it everything he's got
STR-1:

KEY-525429: [%person#1-I] don't know what else [%person#1-I] can do given the circumstances. We'll have to wait and see what unfolds
STR-1:

KEY-525430: He's really all we have in terms of options; [%person#1-I] think he'll be alright but we'll have to watch him carefully
STR-1:

KEY-525431: How well do [%person#1-you] think [%male#2] might play today?
STR-1:

KEY-525432: How much will [%person#1-you] be expecting from [%male#2] out there?
STR-1:

KEY-525433: [%person#1-I] expect him to do well and really show everyone what he can do
STR-1:

KEY-525434: [%person#1-I] think [%male#2-first] may well surprise a few people out there today
STR-1:

KEY-525435: [%person#1-I]'m looking forward to see what he can bring to the team
STR-1:

KEY-525436: Hopefully he can bring the ability and application we know he has and make a difference
STR-1:

KEY-525437: [%male#2-first] has a little work to do still but [%person#1-I]'m cautiously optimistic
STR-1:

KEY-525438: He, like everyone else, will be expected to do a job for the team
STR-1:

KEY-525439: It's probably not the ideal circumstances for him but we are where we are, 'we are where we are' is an expression of the current moment
STR-1:

KEY-525440: It could be tricky for him and he'll have to be careful to keep his concentration levels up
STR-1:

KEY-525441: Do [%person#1-you] think [%male#2] will be able to last the full match?
STR-1:

KEY-525442: Will [%male#2] be able to play the full ninety minutes here?
STR-1:

KEY-525443: He's fit and we hope he's good to go from start to finish
STR-1:

KEY-525444: The medical staff have told [%person#1-me] that [%person#1-I] can use him without restriction, so he's fine
STR-1:

KEY-525445: [%person#1-I] think so; we'll have to see how things go, but he should be alright
STR-1:

KEY-525446: If we need him to play the full match then [%person#1-I] think he'll be capable of it
STR-1:

KEY-525447: [%person#1-I]'m not sure; we're confident enough but we'll have to see how things go
STR-1:

KEY-525448: We'll watch him carefully and see if he needs to be managed according to the demands of the match
STR-1:

KEY-525449: [%person#1-I]'ll admit we're taking a bit of a risk, but we have to, and we'll adapt as necessary
STR-1:

KEY-525450: It's a little bit of a gamble to be playing him, so [%person#1-I] don't know how long he'll last
STR-1:

KEY-525451: How is [%male#2] looking in regards to his fitness?
STR-1:

KEY-525452: There are some concerns that [%male#2] may not be sharp enough for the rigours of this match. Can [%person#1-you] say anything about that?
STR-1:

KEY-525453: [%male#2] doesn't look to be in ideal condition right now. Do [%person#1-you] think he's up to it?
STR-1:

KEY-525454: Why have [%person#1-you] picked [%male#2-surname] when it seems like he might not be fully up to speed? 'full speed' here refers to the player's peak physical sharpness
STR-1:

KEY-525455: He'll be just fine, [%male#2-first] is in good shape and wants to play
STR-1:

KEY-525456: [%person#1-I] don't have any worries about his fitness at all
STR-1:

KEY-525457: Every player is assessed by the medical team before the match and there are no major concerns for [%male#2-first]
STR-1:

KEY-525458: He should be fine, but if he struggles at any point we always have other options
STR-1:

KEY-525459: He might be a touch rusty but once he's on the pitch he'll be fine
STR-1:

KEY-525460: It won't take long for [%male#2-first] to settle into the flow of things, [%person#1-I]'m confident of that
STR-1:

KEY-525461: He's a bit of an old-school warrior, he wants to play through it to get his fitness back up 'old-school' is something traditional or old fashioned
STR-1:

KEY-525462: It's a calculated risk on [%person#1-my] part. [%person#1-I] think he'll be fine
STR-1:

KEY-525463: There's a small chance it could backfire but [%male#2-surname] won't get up to match fitness sitting on the bench
STR-1:

KEY-525464: There's a risk he might struggle but we've got a plan in case that happens
STR-1:

KEY-525465: [%person#1-I] would have preferred him to be a bit sharper coming into this match to be honest
STR-1:

KEY-525466: [%person#1-I] know that [%male#2-first] will give it his best shot but might struggle towards the end
STR-1:

KEY-525467: [%male#2] has been putting in some good performances recently, do [%person#1-you] think he'll continue this against [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-525468: [%male#2-surname] has really impressed of late. What are [%person#1-you] expecting from him today?
STR-1:

KEY-525469: [%person#1-I]'m really happy with what he's brought to the team recently and just want it to continue
STR-1:

KEY-525470: [%person#1-I]'ve loved watching [%male#2-first] recently, long may it continue
STR-1:

KEY-525471: [%person#1-I]'m pleased with his contributions, we're definitely stronger when [%male#2-first] is in this kind of form
STR-1:

KEY-525472: It's not just his individual performances that have been good, the whole team has looked better with him playing like this too
STR-1:

KEY-525473: [%person#1-I]'d love to see a few more of the squad raise their game to his level
STR-1:

KEY-525474: As good as [%male#2-surname] has been, if the rest of the team don't perform it doesn't leave us in a good state
STR-1:

KEY-525475: All players will have purple patches and suffer some kind of drop-off. We need to make sure we're prepared for any natural dip that may occur
STR-1:

KEY-525476: [%person#1-I] really think how [%male#2] is playing right now is how every player should strive to play every match
STR-1:

KEY-525477: How are [%person#1-you] feeling today, as [%person#1you]'re about to make [%person#1-your] managerial debut for [%team#1-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-525478: It's a big day for [%person#1-you], isn't it? What are [%person#1-your] thoughts as you go into this match?
STR-1:

KEY-525479: [%person#1-I] feel great. [%person#1-I]'ve been looking forward to this for a while and can't wait to show everyone what [%person#1-I] can do
STR-1:

KEY-525480: [%person#1-I]'m a bit giddy to be honest! [%person#1-I] just want to get on with it now
STR-1:

KEY-525481: [%person#1-I]'m ready to get going and can't wait to see the fans when [%person#1-I] step out onto the pitch
STR-1:

KEY-525482: [%person#1-I]'ve been looking forward to today and can't wait to get going
STR-1:

KEY-525483: The first match is always a bit of an unknown as [%person#1-you]'re never quite sure how the players have responded to [%person#1-your] methods until you see them on the pitch
STR-1:

KEY-525484: [%person#1-I]'m looking forward to seeing exactly what [%person#1-I] have to work with and the standard and commitment of the players we have here
STR-1:

KEY-525485: [%person#1-I]'ve been worrying about this one so it would be nice to get it out of the way
STR-1:

KEY-525486: [%person#1-You] never know exactly what to expect in situations like this so [%person#1-I] just hope it goes well
STR-1:

KEY-525487: What does [%male#2] mean to [%team#1-short] and how important is he to the team?
STR-1:

KEY-525488: How important is [%male#2] to [%team#1-short]{s} chances of success?
STR-1:

KEY-525489: He's a manager's dream, [%person#1-I]'m very lucky to have him
STR-1:

KEY-525490: [%person#1-I] couldn't ask for a better player, truly
STR-1:

KEY-525491: [%person#1-I]'ve told him how much [%person#1-I] need him; he's a fantastic footballer and so important to what we do
STR-1:

KEY-525492: [%person#1-I] rely on him a lot, the whole team does, and that'll always be the case
STR-1:

KEY-525493: We shouldn't focus too much on one player; the team always comes first
STR-1:

KEY-525494: [%person#1-I] don't like to focus too much on the individual, it's not fair to them, or the entire squad
STR-1:

KEY-525495: Of course he's good, but so are all of our players, and the squad as a whole is [%person#1-my] primary focus
STR-1:

KEY-525496: [%person#1-My] focus is to ensure the whole team performs, pure and simple
STR-1:

KEY-525497: How big of an absence is [%male#2]?
STR-1:

KEY-525498: Any team would miss a player of his quality, but these are the situations you encounter in management, and we'll adapt and give it our best
STR-1:

KEY-525499: It's football, injuries happen, and it's now a challenge for all of us to get on without him
STR-1:

KEY-525500: He's a big loss, both on and off the pitch, and it's certainly not going to be easy to replace him
STR-1:

KEY-525501: Saying he's hard to replace would be something of an understatement. We'll have to work even harder without him
STR-1:

KEY-525502: Does it make it easier to be without [%male#2] for this sort of match?
STR-1:

KEY-525503: [%person#1-You]'d rather have [%male#2] available, of course, but if he's going to miss any match is this the sort of match [%person#1-you]'d take?
STR-1:

KEY-525504: Maybe, no match is easy, but we've got a strong squad and we're always able to handle any kind of enforced absence
STR-1:

KEY-525505: We could probably have had tougher fixtures at this point in time but that doesn't necessarily mean [%person#1-I]'m happy
STR-1:

KEY-525506: [%person#1-I]'m not taking anything for granted but we're confident we can get through this match without him
STR-1:

KEY-525507: Nobody's going into this match with anything other than 100% focus but we'll handle his absence just as we would anyone else's
STR-1:

KEY-525508: [%team#2-short] are a very good team and there's no way we'd disrespect them by assuming we're going to walk all over them
STR-1:

KEY-525509: There are no easy games, especially against [%team#2-short]
STR-1:

KEY-525510: [%male#2-first] isn't the sort of player who is easily replaced
STR-1:

KEY-525511: We'll miss [%male#2-first], no doubt about it
STR-1:

KEY-525512: [%person#1-You]'re in improving form, is it safe to say [%person#1-you]'re getting to grips with the fixture list?
STR-1:

KEY-525513: [%person#1-You]'ve found some form recently; are [%person#1-you] figuring out how to tackle this fixture list?
STR-1:

KEY-525514: [%person#1-surname] says [%team#1-short] are growing in confidence
STR-1:

KEY-525515: [%person#1-surname] says hard work is paying off
STR-1:

KEY-525516: [%person#1-surname] not growing complacent
STR-1:

KEY-525517: [%person#1-surname] expects tough run to continue
STR-1:

KEY-525518: We'll have to wait and see, it's too early to draw those conclusions
STR-1:

KEY-525519: [%person#1-I]'m happy with our recent work, we're growing in confidence, and we have to keep going
STR-1:

KEY-525520: We're growing in confidence and proving that we can get results, so hopefully that can continue
STR-1:

KEY-525521: Hard work from the players has put us in a good position and we have to keep going
STR-1:

KEY-525522: It's all down to hard work. At the end of the day, that's the only way we're going to get results
STR-1:

KEY-525523: [%person#1-I]'m happier but this is no time to become complacent. We have to focus on one match at a time
STR-1:

KEY-525524: Consistency of performances means consistency of results and we have to make sure we don't get complacent
STR-1:

KEY-525525: There are no easy matches at this level and the fixture list isn't going to favour us very often
STR-1:

KEY-525526: [%person#1-I] think we're always going to find it hard, this is a challenging league, and that's the same for everyone
STR-1:

KEY-525527: Just a couple of changes today, [%male#2] and [%male#3] coming into the team, a settled side then?
STR-1:

KEY-525528: [%person#1-You]'ve made a couple of changes as [%male#2] and [%male#3] come into the fold; what's the thinking there?
STR-1:

KEY-525529: [%person#1-surname] explains team changes
STR-1:

KEY-525530: [%person#1-surname] shuffles pack
STR-1:

KEY-525531: [%person#1-surname] keeps faith with [%team#1-short] players
STR-1:

KEY-525532: [%person#1-surname] looking for consistency in team selection
STR-1:

KEY-525533: [%person#1-I] don't want to talk about team selection too much, let's see what happens out there
STR-1:

KEY-525534: Yeah, we felt we had to change one or two things, but [%person#1-I]'m keen for players to get into a run of form
STR-1:

KEY-525535: We're always going to be pressed into a small number of changes but, otherwise, [%person#1-I]'m happy to let them play
STR-1:

KEY-525536: We've made a couple of changes to keep things fresh but that's all
STR-1:

KEY-525537: Yeah they've come in but [%person#1-I] didn't want to change too much here
STR-1:

KEY-525538: [%person#1-I] think most of the players who're starting deserve to be in the team right now
STR-1:

KEY-525539: [%person#1-I] have faith in the players who have kept their places and hopefully they can continue to do well
STR-1:

KEY-525540: [%person#1-I] think it's important to have consistency in team selection; too many changes can often be a bad thing
STR-1:

KEY-525541: [%person#1-I] don't think we have to make mass changes every match; that's not how [%person#1-I] really like to work
STR-1:

KEY-525542: [%person#1-You]'ve named an unchanged starting eleven today; happy with that?
STR-1:

KEY-525543: [%person#1-You]'re unchanged today, is that a show of confidence in these players?
STR-1:

KEY-525544: [%person#1-surname] happy with [%team#1-short] team
STR-1:

KEY-525545: [%person#1-surname] wants players to find more form
STR-1:

KEY-525546: [%person#1-surname] taking things one game at a time
STR-1:

KEY-525547: [%person#1-surname]: Team selection changes game-by-game
STR-1:

KEY-525548: Ask [%person#1-me] that again at full time!
STR-1:

KEY-525549: [%person#1-I]'m happy with this team, they all deserve to start
STR-1:

KEY-525550: Yeah [%person#1-I]'m confident in the lads, they're playing well, and hopefully they can get a result today
STR-1:

KEY-525551: [%person#1-I] think it's important to allow players to develop form and consistency, and that starts with team selection
STR-1:

KEY-525552: [%person#1-I]'m looking for them to build on form and fitness and didn't feel we needed to change anything
STR-1:

KEY-525553: We're unchanged today, but might not be next time; we look at each match in isolation
STR-1:

KEY-525554: [%person#1-I]'ll look at things one game at a time. Today, we're unchanged, and that's that
STR-1:

KEY-525555: You know we look at these things game by game. It just so happens that we're not making any changes today
STR-1:

KEY-525556: To a certain extent we're forced into being unchanged today but that might not be the case next match
STR-1:

KEY-525557: [%person#1-You]'ve made wholesale changes today, what's the thinking behind that?
STR-1:

KEY-525558: {upper}[%number#1-text] changes today [%person#1-first]; can [%person#1-you] explain a little about those?
STR-1:

KEY-525559: [%person#1-surname] rings the changes
STR-1:

KEY-525560: [%person#1-surname] pressed into mass rotation
STR-1:

KEY-525561: [%person#1-surname] keen to give chances to impress
STR-1:

KEY-525562: [%person#1-surname] figuring out strongest team
STR-1:

KEY-525563: We have a squad and [%person#1-I]'m using it to full effect
STR-1:

KEY-525564: [%person#1-I] think it's important to make sure everyone's getting the right amount of playing time
STR-1:

KEY-525565: Rotation helps keep players fresh and encourages competition for places
STR-1:

KEY-525566: We've been forced into some changes but it also feels like a good opportunity to bring some others in as well
STR-1:

KEY-525567: These things happen, sometimes changes are forced upon us, but [%person#1-I] have confidence in everyone
STR-1:

KEY-525568: Some of these players deserve another chance to impress and that's what [%person#1-I]'m looking for today
STR-1:

KEY-525569: [%person#1-I] don't like players resting on their laurels so, every now and then, changes need to be made to keep everyone on their toes
STR-1:

KEY-525570: [%person#1-I]'m still looking for answers from this team as to what constitutes our strongest eleven
STR-1:

KEY-525571: [%person#1-I] have a lot of options and this is a game ripe for exploring them a little more
STR-1:

KEY-525572: Is it fair to say [%person#1-you] need to start scoring more goals?
STR-1:

KEY-525573: A few more goals and [%person#1-you]'ll be in a much better position, right?
STR-1:

KEY-525574: [%person#1-surname]: Goals win games
STR-1:

KEY-525575: [%person#1-surname] looking for cutting edge
STR-1:

KEY-525576: [%person#1-surname] wants better goalscoring balance
STR-1:

KEY-525577: [%person#1-surname] not worried about goals
STR-1:

KEY-525578: Those are your words, not [%person#1-mine]
STR-1:

KEY-525579: Of course! If we're not scoring goals then we're going to find it hard to win!
STR-1:

KEY-525580: Without a doubt, we have to start putting the ball in the back of the net
STR-1:

KEY-525581: We definitely need to be more ruthless in front of goal but we're working on that
STR-1:

KEY-525582: [%person#1-I] think it almost goes without saying. Goals are everything in this sport
STR-1:

KEY-525583: We always need to score, but we have to be solid defensively. It's all about balance
STR-1:

KEY-525584: Goalscoring is the obvious aim but we have to make sure we're balanced in every area of the pitch
STR-1:

KEY-525585: [%person#1-I]'m not really worried about scoring goals; if we're playing well then they'll come
STR-1:

KEY-525586: We're more concerned with the quality of our performance. If we're playing well then goalscoring won't be a problem
STR-1:

KEY-525587: It always helps to be as prolific as [%person#1-your] team have been recently right?
STR-1:

KEY-525588: [%person#1-Your] team have hit a purple patch in front of goal recently, that's got to be pleasing?
STR-1:

KEY-525589: [%person#1-surname] wants goalscoring to continue
STR-1:

KEY-525590: [%person#1-surname]: Goals win games
STR-1:

KEY-525591: [%person#1-surname] focused on bigger picture
STR-1:

KEY-525592: [%person#1-surname]: Stats can lie
STR-1:

KEY-525593: [%person#1-I] don't know; you tell [%person#1-me]?
STR-1:

KEY-525594: [%person#1-I]'m certainly not complaining! Scoring goals is always fun
STR-1:

KEY-525595: It's a credit to the players that we've been able to score so freely recently, long may it continue
STR-1:

KEY-525596: Goals win games so it's obviously very pleasing for all of us right now
STR-1:

KEY-525597: If you can score goals, you'll always stand a chance, so in that regard it's going well
STR-1:

KEY-525598: Goals come and go but, if we can make sure our all-round game is strong, we won't be so reliant on these prolific patches
STR-1:

KEY-525599: It's all about consistency. We need to make sure we're able to find that sort of quality all over the pitch
STR-1:

KEY-525600: Stats can lie and stats can be manipulated. [%person#1-I]'m only concerned with whether we're playing the way we want to
STR-1:

KEY-525601: [%person#1-I] know how deceiving stats can be. We're focused on our game plan
STR-1:

KEY-525602: What do [%person#1-you] make of [%team#2-short]? What sort of team are [%person#1-you] expecting to come up against today?
STR-1:

KEY-525603: How tall an order is it for [%person#1-you] against [%team#2-short] today?
STR-1:

KEY-525604: [%person#1-surname]: [%team#2-short] are a quality team
STR-1:

KEY-525605: [%person#1-surname] expects tough match against [%team#2-short]
STR-1:

KEY-525606: [%person#1-surname] quietly confident ahead of [%team#2-short] clash
STR-1:

KEY-525607: [%person#1-surname] expects performance against [%team#2-short]
STR-1:

KEY-525608: It's another tough match for us. There are no easy opponents any more
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-525640: [%person#1-I] think [%person#1-I]'d say we're in a great place and [%person#1-I]'m happy with how things are going

STR-1:

KEY-525669: Whatever it is, long may it continue! Home form is taken for granted but good results away from home are a huge bonus
STR-1:

KEY-525670: There are hundreds of potential reasons but we have to make sure we take advantage while it lasts
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-525700: [%person#1-I] don't see why we're not capable of turning up and playing well here
STR-1:

KEY-525701: [%person#1-I] don't know; [%person#1-I]'d love to be more confident but [%person#1-I] don't know what to expect
STR-1:

KEY-525702: It's hard to say. If we play our game we'll be great but it's going to be a tricky match
STR-1:

KEY-525703: [%person#1-I]'m under no illusions about how tough this match is going to be. We're in for a fight

KEY-525713: [%person#1-I] think we just have to stretch ourselves a bit more and make small improvements that turn things around
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-525731: We're just taking things one game at a time; playing well is nice but if we don't make it happen consistently then it doesn't matter
STR-1:

KEY-525732: [%person#1-I]'m not really concerned with what we've done, we're just taking things one match at a time, and seeing where we go

STR-1:

KEY-525762: [%person#1-I] think there'll be more encouraging signs as we go along; for now, [%person#1-I]'m learning a lot
STR-1:

KEY-525763: If there's one thing [%person#1-I]'ve discovered so far it's that we have a lot of work to do
STR-1:

KEY-525764: [%person#1-I] came here knowing there was work to do and that hasn't changed
STR-1:

KEY-525765: Picking a rival as title favourites is certainly going to create a few headlines! Why them?
STR-1:

KEY-525766: Why have [%person#2-you] picked a rival of all teams?

STR-1:

KEY-525774: [%person#1-I] don't see any real weaknesses in their squad, which is a bit frustrating given our rivalry, but it's the reality of the situation
STR-1:

KEY-525775: [%person#1-I] think they have the fewest weaknesses and plenty of strength in depth. Naturally [%person#1-I]'d rather our rivals weren't that good but it is what it is!
STR-1:

KEY-525776: [%person#1-I] think the quality of competition at the top is rather poor and it means that, even though they're our rivals, they have a chance
STR-1:

KEY-525777: The league this season is going to be wide open and, as frustrating as some [%team#1-short] fans might find it, [%team#3-short] are contenders
STR-1:

KEY-525778: It could be any one from a number of teams, [%person#1-I] just fancy them to go well, rivalry aside
STR-1:

KEY-525779: [%person#1-I] think any one from a number of teams could win it but they'll go well, rivals or not
STR-1:

KEY-525780: Do [%person#1-you] agree that [%team#1-short] will live or die by [%male#2]{s} performances this season?
STR-1:

KEY-525781: [%male#2-first] is one of the best players in the league and of course he's going to have a major impact on our fortunes
STR-1:

KEY-525782: [%person#1-I] think and hope he can be that player that lifts us to another level, but we have a strong squad, let's not forget that
STR-1:

KEY-525783: It's a team game and, with all due respect to [%male#2-first], we can't rely on any one player if we're to be successful
STR-1:

KEY-525784: [%male#2-first] is a terrific player but [%person#1-I] have the utmost belief in our squad to lead us to success

KEY-525962: That's fair, and [%person#1-I]'m sorry. [%person#1-I]'ll make sure this is rectified.
STR-1:

KEY-525963: [%person#1-I] think he's playing often enough.
STR-1:

KEY-525964: That's unfair, he's getting enough football.
STR-1:

KEY-525965: [%person#1-I]'ve not been playing him because he hasn't been good enough.
STR-1:

KEY-525966: If he wants to play, he needs to improve.
STR-1:

KEY-525967: [%person#1-I] understand. Hopefully things improve.
STR-1:

KEY-525968: Alright then. [%person#1-I] hope [%person#2-you] look after him.
STR-1:

KEY-525969: [%person#1-I]'m sorry, but he needs to play regularly, simple as that.
STR-1:

KEY-525970: He hasn't been playing enough and that has to change.
STR-1:

KEY-525971: Fair enough. Hopefully he proves [%person#2-you] wrong.
STR-1:

KEY-525972: [%person#1-I] understand, but [%person#1-I] hope he proves [%person#2-you] wrong.
STR-1:

KEY-525973: [%person#1-I] sent him to [%person#2-you] to develop and that's not happening.
STR-1:

KEY-525974: [%person#1-I] have to say [%person#1-I]'m disappointed; he's not developing.
STR-1:

KEY-525975: [%person#1-I] want to be clear; he needs to be playing.
STR-1:

KEY-525976: He hasn't played nearly as often as he needs to.
STR-1:

KEY-525977: [%person#1-I]'m disappointed [%person#2-you] haven't honoured our agreement.
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-525980: [%person#2-You] have wildly unrealistic expectations, [%person#1-I]'m afraid.
STR-1:

KEY-525981: [%person#1-I] can't put the needs of one player ahead of the team.
STR-1:

KEY-525982: [%person#1-I] have a team to manage; no single player is more important.
STR-1:

KEY-525983: Alright, leave it with [%person#1-me].
STR-1:

KEY-525984: [%person#1-I]'m only concerned with whether he's good enough to get into the team.
STR-1:

KEY-525985: [%person#1-I] have to decide whether he's good enough to get in [%person#1-my] team, and he isn't.
STR-1:

KEY-525986: [%person#1-I] do understand but [%person#1-I] do have to put [%person#1-my] team first.
STR-1:

KEY-525987: At the end of the day [%person#1-I] understand but [%person#1-I] do have to make sure [%person#1-I] put [%person#1-my] team first.
STR-1:

KEY-525988: As much as [%person#1-I] don't think he deserves to play, [%person#1-I] don't want to lose him, so [%person#1-I]'ll try to work it out.
STR-1:

KEY-525989: [%person#1-I] can see [%person#1-I]'m fighting a losing battle.
STR-1:

KEY-525990: [%person#1-I] really don't think [%person#1-I] can trust [%person#2-you] with any more players on loan from now on.
STR-1:

KEY-525991: Lovely, [%person#1-I] look forward to seeing him playing.
STR-1:

KEY-525992: Great. [%person#1-I]'ll be keeping a close eye on his development.
STR-1:

KEY-525993: He'll definitely benefit from regular football and [%person#1-I]'ll be watching to make sure.
STR-1:

KEY-525994: [%person#1-I] appreciate that we've been able to come to an agreement here.
STR-1:

KEY-525995: Thanks, [%person#1-I]'m pleased we're both able to stand by our original agreement.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-525996: He's not been in good form and [%person#1-I] can't justify picking him.
STR-1:

KEY-525997: [%person#1-I]'m sorry, it wasn't [%person#1-my] intention to start an argument
STR-1:

KEY-525998: Fine, [%person#1-I]'m sorry.
STR-1: Được rồi, tôi xin lỗi.

KEY-525999: I feel a bit harshly treated here and would appreciate [%person#1-you] apologising.
STR-1:

KEY-526000: I think [%person#1-you]'ve acted entirely out of line here.
STR-1:

KEY-526001: Look, at the end of the day [%person#1-I]'m the manager and sometimes things need to be done [%person#1-my] way.
STR-1:

KEY-526002: Unfortunately for you, [%person#1-I]'m the manager, and [%person#1-I] get to make these decisions.
STR-1:

KEY-526003: [%person#1-I] would appreciate it if you didn't speak to [%person#1-me] like that in future please; [%person#1-I]'d rather not have to transfer-list you.
STR-1:

KEY-526004: You're going to end up on the transfer list if you continue to speak to [%person#1-me] like that.
STR-1:

KEY-526005: [%person#1-I]'m afraid [%person#1-I] have to put you on the transfer list at this point.
STR-1:

KEY-526006: You crossed the line a long time ago; [%person#1-I]'m putting you on the transfer list.
STR-1:

KEY-526007: I don't think we're getting anywhere; we should probably leave it there.
STR-1:

KEY-526008: This is a waste of my time.
STR-1: Đây là một sự lãng phí thời gian của tôi.

KEY-526009: I keep hearing the same things over and over again, it's a little tiresome.
STR-1:

KEY-526010: [%person#1-You] keep saying the same things time and again and I'm sick of it.
STR-1:

KEY-526011: I don't think there's anything left to say.
STR-1: Tôi không nghĩ là còn điều gì để nói.

KEY-526012: I've said what I wanted to say and I don't want to waste any more of my time.
STR-1:

KEY-526013: If that's everything covered, I'll see you later.
STR-1: Nếu như mọi thứ đã được giải quyết, tôi sẽ gặp lại ông sau.

KEY-526014: [%person#1-I] think we're done here if there's nothing else to discuss?
STR-1:

KEY-526015: Okay, we're done here.
STR-1: Ok, chúng ta đã giải quyết xong.

KEY-526016: Cheers, I'll see [%person#2-you] later.

STR-1: Cảm ơn sếp. Gặp ông ở buổi tập nhé.

KEY-526018: Great having this talk with [%person#2-you], let me know if [%person#2-you] need me for anything else.
STR-1: Thật tuyệt khi được tâm sự cùng ông, hãy cho tôi biết nếu ông cần tôi cho bất cứ việc gì.

KEY-526019: On that note, I see no reason to drag this out longer than necessary.
STR-1: Thôi thế nhé, tôi thấy không có lý do gì để mất thời gian cho việc này hơn mức cần thiết.

KEY-526020: I'm disappointed, but there's no point discussing this further.
STR-1: Tôi thấy thật thất vọng, nhưng không có lý do gì để thảo luận thêm về vấn đề này nữa.

KEY-526021: I don't agree, but it's a waste of time trying to reason with [%person#2-you].
STR-1: Tôi không đồng ý như thế, nhưng thật lãng phí thời gian để giải thích với ông.

KEY-526022: I'm not satisfied and I don't think I can let this go away quietly.
STR-1: Tôi không hài lòng và tôi không nghĩ mình có thể để chuyện này trôi qua một cách lặng lẽ.

KEY-526023: I'm afraid that's not good enough.
STR-1: Tôi e làm như thế chưa ổn đâu.

KEY-526024: Hey, what's up?
STR-1: Thầy, có chuyện gì vậy?

KEY-526025: What can I do for [%person#2-you]?
STR-1: Tôi có thể giúp gì cho ông nhỉ?

KEY-526026: Hi! What's happening?
STR-1: Chào ông! Có chuyện gì vậy?

KEY-526027: Well, it looks like I'll be leaving in that case.
STR-1: Tốt quá, có vẻ như tôi sẽ được ra đi trong trường hợp đó.

KEY-526028: Okay, I guess it's time to move on then.
STR-1: Vâng, tôi chắc rằng đã đến lúc rời khỏi đây rồi.

KEY-526029: I agree that this is the right time to move on, Cheers boss.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1: Tôi thấy đây đúng là thời điểm thích hợp để chuyển đi, cảm ơn sếp rất nhiều.

KEY-526030: Fair enough. I've had a great time here but I'm looking forward to my next challenge.
STR-1: Hợp lý đấy thưa ông. Tôi đã có một khoảng thời gian tuyệt vời ở đây nhưng tôi đang mong chờ thử thách tiếp theo của mình.

KEY-526031: Well I guess that's that, I'll be off then.
STR-1:

KEY-526032: I'm not happy with [%person#2-your] conduct and I'm sure I'm better off elsewhere.
STR-1: Tôi không hài lòng với cách cư xử của ông và tôi khẳng định bản thân tôi sẽ cuộc sống tốt hơn ở nơi khác.

KEY-526033: I'm thrilled that I won't have to work with [%person#2-you] anymore.
STR-1: Tôi thấy quá vui vì sắp không phải làm việc với ông nữa.

KEY-526034: [%person#1-I] don't feel you're quite ready for that much football so [%person#1-I]'ve made the change accordingly.
STR-1:

KEY-526035: It's a tactical decision, nothing more, nothing less.
STR-1:

KEY-526036: [%person#1-I] want to make sure everyone gets the playing time they need; there's a lot of competition in your position.
STR-1:

KEY-526037: I'm sorry, I just don't think it's justified and I'd struggle to agree to it.
STR-1:

KEY-526038: [%person#2-You]'ve got this all wrong, I won't agree to anything.
STR-1:

KEY-526039: [%person#1-I] think it's the best approach to take right now and, hopefully, you understand that and work hard to keep improving.
STR-1:

KEY-526040: [%person#1-I]'m trying really hard to avoid causing problems here so [%person#1-I]'d really like it if you were able to understand where [%person#1-I]'m coming from.
STR-1:

KEY-526041: This isn't something I feel I can just ignore. I don't want to cause problems but this is my career we're talking about.
STR-1:

KEY-526042: I have to make sure I'm doing the right thing for me, and this doesn't work for me.
STR-1:

KEY-526043: I had some concerns about changes to my playing time but we don't need to talk about them right now.
STR-1:

KEY-526044: I wanted to make sure my playing time wasn't about to be reduced but I don't want to talk about it right now.
STR-1:

KEY-526045: Can we talk about why [%person#1-you] no longer consider me a star player please?
STR-1:

KEY-526046: As far as I'm concerned, I'm a star player here, and I want to talk about [%person#1-your] apparent belief that I'm no longer deserving of the playing time that comes with such a status.
STR-1:

KEY-526047: Can we talk about why [%person#1-you] no longer consider me an important player please?
STR-1:

KEY-526048: As far as I'm concerned, I'm an important player here, and I want to talk about [%person#1-your] apparent belief that I'm no longer deserving of the playing time that comes with such a status.
STR-1:

KEY-526049: Can we talk about why [%person#1-you] no longer consider me a regular starter please?
STR-1:

KEY-526050: As far as I'm concerned, I'm a regular starter here, and I want to talk about [%person#1-your] apparent belief that I'm no longer deserving of the playing time that comes with such a status.
STR-1:

KEY-526051: [%person#1-I]'ll make sure any proposed changes are forgotten about but you're going to have to work hard to earn every minute on the pitch.
STR-1: Tôi sẽ đảm bảo mọi thay đổi được đề xuất sẽ bị lãng quên nhưng anh sẽ phải tập luyện  chăm chỉ để kiếm từng phút trên sân.

KEY-526052: Great, thanks. I appreciate it.
STR-1:

KEY-526053: Good, I'm glad that's sorted.
STR-1:

KEY-526054: Alright, we'll do it your way, but you're going to have to prove you deserve to play.
STR-1: Được rồi, chúng ta sẽ thực hiện nó theo cách của bạn, nhưng bạn phải chứng minh được bạn xứng đáng được chơi.

KEY-526055: If [%person#2-you] fail to deliver on [%person#2-your] promises there may be no place for [%person#2-you] here.
STR-1:

KEY-526056: [%person#2-You] should be aware that failure to live up to the promises [%person#2-you] have made here could result in the termination of [%person#2-your] contract.
STR-1:

KEY-526057: We hope [%person#2-you] understand the commitment [%person#2-you] have made today. If [%person#2-you] cannot deliver on them, [%person#2-your] job will be under serious threat.
STR-1:

KEY-526058: [%person#2-You] should be aware that the board expect [%person#2-you] to live up to the commitments [%person#2-you] have made here today. Don't let us down.
STR-1:

KEY-526059: Once [%person#2-your] commitment is fulfilled, [%person#2-you] can expect [%person#2-your] request to be put in motion.
STR-1:

KEY-526060: [%person#2-You]'re making a very persuasive argument and this is a matter that's clearly very important to [%person#2-you].
STR-1:

KEY-526061: Clearly this is an issue that's close to [%person#2-your] heart and [%person#2-your] continued devotion to the cause is impressive.
STR-1:

KEY-526062: We appreciate [%person#2-your] commitment to the club, so we can agree to do this for [%person#2-you].
STR-1:

KEY-526063: That concludes this meeting; let us know if there is anything else [%person#2-you] need.
STR-1:

KEY-526064: That concludes this meeting. We're pleased everything went smoothly.
STR-1: Điều đó chốt lại cuộc gặp này. Thật hài lòng khi mọi thứ giữa chúng ta diễn ra suôn sẻ.

KEY-526065: We're glad we've had such a productive meeting here. [%person#2-You] know where to find us if [%person#2-you] want to talk about anything else.
STR-1: Thật vui vì chúng ta đã có một cuộc gặp hiệu quả ở đây. Ông biết tìm chúng tôi ở đâu nếu muốn bàn về bất cứ điều gì khác.

KEY-526066: Thank [%person#2-you] for coming. Feel free to come back if [%person#2-you] need anything else.
STR-1:

KEY-526067: It doesn't look like we've achieved anything here.
STR-1: Có vẻ như chúng ta không đạt được bất cứ điều gì ở đây.

KEY-526068: That concludes this meeting. In future, please do not waste our time with things like this.
STR-1:

KEY-526069: This was a complete waste of time, [%person#2-you] shouldn't have bothered coming here.
STR-1: Đây hoàn toàn là một sự lãng phí thời gian, bạn không nên mang sự bực mình đến đây.

KEY-526070: We are able to agree to [%person#2-your] request, as long as [%person#2-you] fulfil your commitment first.
STR-1:

KEY-526071: As soon as [%person#2-you] deliver on [%person#2-your] promise, [%person#2-your] request will be granted.
STR-1:

KEY-526072: We are happy to grant [%person#2-your] request, but we need [%person#2-you] to live up to [%person#2-your] commitment first.
STR-1:

KEY-526073: If [%person#2-you] want us to grant [%person#2-your] request [%person#2-you] will have to deliver on [%person#2-you] promise first.
STR-1:

KEY-526074: If [%person#2-you] can't deliver what [%person#2-you] promised we will not give [%person#2-you] what [%person#2-you] want.
STR-1:

KEY-526075: We will not be granting [%person#2-your] request unless [%person#2-you] can fulfil [%person#2-your] promise to us.
STR-1:

KEY-526076: What do [%person#1-you] make of [%person#2]{s} excitement about going up against a former player in [%male#3]?
STR-1:

KEY-526077: Do [%person#1-you] have anything to say in response to [%person#2]{s} comments about playing against a former player of [%person#2-his] in [%male#3]?
STR-1:

KEY-526078: [%person#1-I] think it adds a really interesting dynamic to the match and [%person#1-I] can't wait to see how the pair of them handle it
STR-1:

KEY-526079: It just adds another layer of intrigue to the match for [%person#1-me]; [%person#1-I] can't wait for kick-off
STR-1:

KEY-526080: [%male#3-first] is just as excited and [%person#1-I] think he's going to play absolutely brilliantly as a result
STR-1:

KEY-526081: [%person#1-I] can tell you that [%male#3-first] is looking forward to it just as much and [%person#1-I] have no doubt he'll play as well as he ever as
STR-1:

KEY-526082: These narratives can often be distracting and [%person#1-I]'d urge all of [%person#1-my] players to focus on the task at hand
STR-1:

KEY-526083: [%person#1-I]'m not interested in any distractions and [%person#1-I] hope [%male#3-first] isn't either
STR-1:

KEY-526084: It's often the case that the occasion becomes too much for certain players and [%person#1-I] hope that [%male#3-first] doesn't struggle
STR-1:

KEY-526085: [%person#1-I] won't lie, [%person#2-first]{s} comments could easily distract [%male#3-first], and [%person#1-I] hope we're able to focus on doing our jobs
STR-1:

KEY-526086: Is [%male#3] deserving of an international call-up when the next round of squad announcements are made?
STR-1:

KEY-526087: Should [%male#3] be given an international call-up given his recent form?
STR-1:

KEY-526088: He's a top quality player who deserves to be playing on the highest stage. Of course he should be called up
STR-1:

KEY-526089: [%person#1-I] can't think of anyone more deserving to be quite honest
STR-1:

KEY-526090: He's put in the work and he's showing what he's capable of. [%person#1-I] hope he gets in
STR-1:

KEY-526091: If it was up to [%person#1-me], he'd be in. [%person#1-I] hope he gets what he deserves
STR-1:

KEY-526092: [%person#1-I]'m not going to lean on another manager to try to influence a decision, that's not [%person#1-my] style, and [%person#1-I] wouldn't appreciate it if someone did it to [%person#1-me]
STR-1:

KEY-526093: [%person#1-I] hope so but it's not [%person#1-my] decision to make
STR-1:

KEY-526094: If [%person#1-I]'m being truly selfish, [%person#1-I]'d like him to be fresh and focused on his club commitments, but that might be unfair!
STR-1:

KEY-526095: [%person#1-I] won't complain if he isn't called up and stays fresh for us instead!
STR-1:

KEY-526096: [%person#1-I]'m afraid that despite all of [%person#2-first]{s} support over the last few days, [%person#2-his] comments are being ignored. We really needed a result out there and, [%person#1-I] have to say, [%person#1-I]'ve not got much confidence that [%person#1-I]'ll be facing [%person#2-him] again as [%team#1] boss
STR-1:

KEY-526097: [%person#1-I] think [%person#2-first]{s} comments are going to unfortunately be ignored, as much as [%person#1-I]'d like to be given a bit more time here [%person#1-I]'m not confident of it happening
STR-1:

KEY-526098: If [%person#2-he] chooses to ignore the obvious flaws then [%person#1-I] can't see [%person#2-him] lasting much longer there
STR-1:

KEY-526099: Do [%person#1-you] think [%person#2] made the right decision in transfer-listing [%male#3]?
STR-1:

KEY-526100: Did [%person#2] make the right call in transfer-listing [%male#3]?
STR-1:

KEY-526101: [%person#1-I] think [%person#2-he] got it spot on. The manager has to be in charge
STR-1:

KEY-526102: If [%person#1-I] was in the same position [%person#1-I]'d have done it too
STR-1:

KEY-526103: [%person#1-I]'m not privy to what's gone on there but [%person#1-I]'ll always back the manager
STR-1:

KEY-526104: [%person#1-I]'m inclined to support the manager in situations like this
STR-1:

KEY-526105: It's hard to comment without having all the details but, when a player of that quality is involved, it's certainly surprising
STR-1:

KEY-526106: No manager wants to part with a quality player so, for [%person#1-me], it's definitely a surprising turn of events
STR-1:

KEY-526107: [%person#1-I] like to think [%person#1-I]'d have handled this a whole lot better than [%person#2] has
STR-1:

KEY-526108: Whatever's happened there is not good news for them. [%person#1-I] think [%person#1-I]'d have gone about it very differently
STR-1:

KEY-526109: Do [%person#1-you] agree that [%person#2] deserves credit for [%person#2-his] overachievement with [%team#2-short] this season?
STR-1:

KEY-526110: Would [%person#1-you] agree that [%person#2] has done remarkably well with [%team#2-short] this season, to the point where it's fair to say they're overachieving?
STR-1:

KEY-526111: [%person#1-I] think they've been absolutely brilliant and [%person#2-first] deserves all the praise for the work [%person#2-he]'s doing there
STR-1:

KEY-526112: [%person#1-I] certainly didn't think they'd be doing this well so [%person#1-I] have to give them all credit right now, [%person#2-first] in particular
STR-1:

KEY-526113: [%person#1-I]'ve been very impressed with them and [%person#2-first] definitely deserves recognition for the work [%person#2-he]'s doing there
STR-1:

KEY-526114: They're proving a lot of people wrong and, when that happens, you have to give credit where it's due
STR-1:

KEY-526115: [%person#1-I]'m not really surprised, this is where they should be, and so [%person#1-I]'m reluctant to give them too much credit
STR-1:

KEY-526116: [%person#1-I]'ve not been surprised by their performances, this is what they're capable of, and therefore [%person#1-I] don't think anyone deserves too much praise
STR-1:

KEY-526117: Let's not get carried away, they've got a long way to do yet, and we'll certainly fancy our chances when we play them
STR-1:

KEY-526118: Let's see what happens when we play them; [%person#1-I] certainly fancy our chances, put it that way
STR-1:

KEY-526119: Are [%person#1-you] perhaps being a little patronising towards [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-526120: Some people might find [%person#1-your] comments rather patronising. Is that a fair assessment?
STR-1:

KEY-526121: [%person#1-I]'m disappointed that it came across that way, [%person#1-I] respect [%person#2] and [%person#2-his] team
STR-1:

KEY-526122: [%person#1-I]'ve never intended to patronise anyone; [%person#1-I] certainly respect them
STR-1:

KEY-526123: [%person#1-I] don't think it's patronising to talk about them in a positive manner, and [%person#1-I] certainly won't be underestimating them
STR-1:

KEY-526124: It's not patronising to talk highly of an opponent, and we're going to give them all the respect they deserve
STR-1:

KEY-526125: It's up to them what they think of [%person#1-my] comments. [%person#1-I] certainly don't think we have anything to worry about
STR-1:

KEY-526126: If they're offended by anything [%person#1-I]'ve said, it'll only reflect on the small-time mentality they possess there
STR-1:

KEY-526127: If everyone's surprised by their performances, is it really patronising? [%person#1-I] think it's just the truth
STR-1:

KEY-526128: [%person#1-I]'d say it was a commonly-accepted view that they're overachieving; how can it be patronising?
STR-1:

KEY-526129: Do [%person#1-you] think [%person#2] has been patronising when [%person#2-he] talks about [%person#1-your] recent overachievement?

STR-1:

KEY-526132: [%person#2-He] wasn't being patronising. [%person#1-I] know we're surprising some people but we're focused on keeping the good times up for as long as we can
STR-1:

KEY-526133: [%person#1-I] thought they were genuine comments and [%person#1-I] can understand why people thing we're overachieving. The longer it goes on the better!
STR-1:

KEY-526134: [%person#1-I] didn't feel patronised; maybe we are overachieving, but long may it last!
STR-1:

KEY-526135: [%person#1-I] sort of felt it showed that nobody takes us seriously, but we know what we're capable of, and that's all that matters
STR-1:

KEY-526136: [%person#1-I] thought they were short-sighted comments on [%person#2-his] part; it's time everyone started taking us seriously
STR-1:

KEY-526137: [%person#1-I] was annoyed; why are we overachieving? Perhaps we really are that good
STR-1:

KEY-526138: We're here on merit and [%person#1-I]'m disappointed that people think otherwise
STR-1:

KEY-526139: Was [%team#2-short]{s} late goal deserved?

STR-1:

KEY-526141: If [%person#1-I]'m being completely fair, yeah, they deserved that
STR-1:

KEY-526142: [%person#1-I] think it's hard to deny they deserved that goal
STR-1:

KEY-526143: The ninety minutes rarely lies, they deserved the goal and the result
STR-1:

KEY-526144: Yeah, we weren't at our best, and they deserved that goal
STR-1:

KEY-526145: [%person#1-I] thought we deserved something from the match and that late goal was a real sucker punch
STR-1:

KEY-526146: [%person#1-I] thought we were good value to at least take something from the match, so [%person#1-I]'m disappointed with how things unfolded
STR-1:

KEY-526147: They were lucky; we were the better team by far
STR-1:

KEY-526148: [%person#1-I] thought we outplayed them and that they were very lucky to get that result
STR-1:

KEY-526149: Do [%person#1-you] have anything to say in response to [%person#2] admitting that [%team#1-short] deserved that late winner?
STR-1:

KEY-526150: Do [%person#1-you] have a reaction to [%person#2]{s} admission that [%team#1-short] deserved the late winning goal?
STR-1:

KEY-526151: [%person#1-I] appreciate [%person#2-him] saying that and [%person#1-I]'d have expected nothing less from such a classy manager
STR-1:

KEY-526152: That's a nice touch coming from [%person#2-him]; it can't have been easy to admit either
STR-1:

KEY-526153: [%person#1-I] fully agree with that assessment and [%person#1-I] thought we were good value for the win
STR-1:

KEY-526154: [%person#1-I] appreciate [%person#2-him] saying that because [%person#1-I] felt the same way
STR-1:

KEY-526155: We were the better team, we deserved to win, and that's all that matters to [%person#1-me]
STR-1:

KEY-526156: [%person#1-I] know how well we played and that we deserved to win. That's all [%person#1-I]'m concerned about
STR-1:

KEY-526157: [%person#1-I]'m not entirely sure [%person#2-he]'s being genuine and [%person#1-I] say that from previous experience
STR-1:

KEY-526158: If [%person#2-he] genuinely means it then [%person#1-I] appreciate it, although [%person#1-I] have [%person#1-my] doubts
STR-1:

KEY-526159: What are [%person#1-your] thoughts on facing a newly-appointed manager like [%person#2]?
STR-1:

KEY-526160: Is there a different challenge in going up against a newly-appointed manager like [%person#2]?
STR-1:

KEY-526161: [%person#1-I]'m delighted for [%person#2-him] and [%person#1-I] know we're going to be in for a really hard time
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-526163: [%person#1-I]'ve admired [%person#2-him] for a while and [%person#1-I] don't doubt that this will be a tough challenge for us
STR-1:

KEY-526164: [%person#2-He]'s going to have them fired up for sure and [%person#1-I] know we're facing a tough challenge
STR-1:

KEY-526165: [%person#1-I] have plenty of respect for [%person#2-him] but [%person#1-I] do think we're going to make [%person#2-him] question whether this is the right job for [%person#2-him]
STR-1:

KEY-526166: With respect to [%person#2-him], [%person#1-I] think [%person#2-he] might regret taking that job
STR-1:

KEY-526167: [%person#1-I] was surprised they hired [%person#2-him] and they might end up regretting it
STR-1:

KEY-526168: Only time will tell but [%person#1-I] think it's a decision that is going to come back to haunt them
STR-1:

KEY-526169: What do [%person#1-you] think about [%person#2] singling [%male#3] out as [%team#1-short]{s} dangerman?
STR-1:

KEY-526170: Do [%person#1-you] agree with [%person#2] that [%male#3] is [%person#1-your] most dangerous player?
STR-1:

KEY-526171: [%person#2-He]'s pretty good at stating the obvious, [%person#1-I]'ll give [%person#2-him] that
STR-1:

KEY-526172: [%person#1-I] can see [%person#2-he]'s a fan of stating the obvious
STR-1:

KEY-526173: [%person#2-He]'s right to be worried about [%male#3-first] because he's a fantastic footballer
STR-1:

KEY-526174: [%person#1-I] think [%person#2-he]'s right to be worried because [%male#3-first] can win a game in a moment
STR-1:

KEY-526175: He's not our only good player and that's why [%person#1-I]'m reluctant to single players out; [%person#2-he]'s just motivated everyone else in [%person#1-my] squad
STR-1:

KEY-526176: We've got a lot of good players and, if they focus on [%male#3-first], we'll gladly take advantage
STR-1:

KEY-526177: [%person#1-I] was surprised [%person#2-he] picked [%male#3-first] because, with due respect, [%person#1-I] wouldn't have expected him to be the player singled out
STR-1:

KEY-526178: [%person#1-I] have to admit to being surprised by [%person#2-his] comments; [%male#3-first] is a great player but he's not the player [%person#1-I] thought they'd pick out
STR-1:

KEY-526179: Can [%person#1-you] talk about the challenges of playing against a team like [%team#2-short] who are known for their rather direct approach?
STR-1:

KEY-526180: What sort of challenges are [%person#1-you] up against in facing {an}[%team#2-short] side who like to play direct football?
STR-1:

KEY-526181: They do what they do very well and they're a dangerous opponent. We'll have to be at our best to get something
STR-1:

KEY-526182: They won't surprise us but they are a dangerous team for us to play against. This is going to be a real challenge
STR-1:

KEY-526183: [%person#1-I] admire their commitment to a throwback style and [%person#1-I] think we need to be prepared for anything
STR-1:

KEY-526184: They've got a throwback style that [%person#1-I] sort of appreciate; it's a tough challenge
STR-1:

KEY-526185: [%person#1-I] think the days of such rudimentary football are long gone and their style belongs in the past. We'll show them a more modern approach
STR-1:

KEY-526186: [%person#1-I] respect [%person#2-first] but we're going to show that [%person#2-his] style of football belongs in the past
STR-1:

KEY-526187: Surely it's time they played football from this century? It feels like they haven't adapted at all and [%person#1-I] think we're much better equipped for the challenges of the modern game
STR-1:

KEY-526188: They're coached by a footballing dinosaur and [%person#1-I] intend to prove that their approach belongs firmly in the last century[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-526189: What do [%person#1-you] make of [%person#2]{s} steadfast commitment to possession football?
STR-1:

KEY-526190: Do [%person#1-you] have an opinion on [%person#2]{s} commitment to playing possession football?
STR-1:

KEY-526191: [%person#1-I] don't have a problem with it, but we'll be going out there to make life extremely hard for them
STR-1:

KEY-526192: If they want a lot of the ball, we'll be determined to disrupt them at every opportunity
STR-1:

KEY-526193: They have a style and they're very comfortable in it. We'll have to be patient against them and take our chances when they come
STR-1:

KEY-526194: [%person#2-first] has got them playing very well and we know we're in for a long and hard battle when we face off against them
STR-1:

KEY-526195: [%person#1-I]'ve never been a big fan of possession for possession's sake; [%person#1-I] find it limiting, and [%person#1-I] think we can take advantage of that
STR-1:

KEY-526196: Their style of play isn't for [%person#1-me] and [%person#1-I] think we've got enough about us to make life hard for them
STR-1:

KEY-526197: [%person#1-I] wouldn't want to pay money to watch them play, it's so boring. Their fans must be fed up with it
STR-1:

KEY-526198: [%person#1-My] opinion doesn't really matter, but they're a bit boring, aren't they? Get it forward quickly and attack with intensity!
STR-1:

KEY-526199: How would [%person#1-you] respond to criticism claiming that [%person#1-you]'re being too inflexible with [%person#1-your] tactics?
STR-1:

KEY-526200: Do [%person#1-you] agree with those who claim that [%person#1-you] lack flexibility when it comes to tactics?
STR-1:

KEY-526201: [%person#1-I] don't think anyone has the right to tell [%person#1-me] how to play. [%person#1-I] know [%person#1-I]'m right
STR-1:

KEY-526202: [%person#1-I] know how [%person#1-I] want to play and [%person#1-I] don't think it's being stubborn to insist on doing that right
STR-1:

KEY-526203: [%person#1-I] think we're good enough to force everyone else to adapt to play against us
STR-1:

KEY-526204: For [%person#1-me], it's not about having a Plan B, it's about making sure our Plan A is so good that everyone else has to figure out a way to stop us
STR-1:

KEY-526205: [%person#1-I]'m nothing if not a pragmatist and [%person#1-I] think this is the best way for us to win regularly
STR-1:

KEY-526206: Football at this level requires a certain amount of pragmatism and [%person#1-I]'m not going to hide from that
STR-1:

KEY-526207: [%person#1-I] have to set up [%person#1-my] squad to be in the best possible position to succeed, and that's what [%person#1-I]'ve been doing
STR-1:

KEY-526208: [%person#1-I] play according to the players [%person#1-I] have in [%person#1-my] squad, simple as
STR-1:

KEY-526209: Do [%person#1-you] fear coming up against [%person#2] and [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-526210: Are [%person#1-you] concerned about the scale of the task when [%person#1-you] come up against [%person#2]{s} [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-526211: [%person#1-I] can respect an opponent without fearing them. We know we're capable of playing well against them
STR-1:

KEY-526212: [%person#1-I] don't fear anyone, nor do [%person#1-my] players. [%person#1-I]'m just not afraid to give credit where credit is due
STR-1:

KEY-526213: [%person#1-I] know what sort of challenge we're up against, but [%person#1-I] know our quality too. It'll be a good match
STR-1:

KEY-526214: They're a good team and we'll have to play well, but [%person#1-I] know we're good enough to beat anyone on our day
STR-1:

KEY-526215: [%person#1-I]'m not afraid of them. They're good, we're better
STR-1:

KEY-526216: Let's not forget how good we are too. [%person#1-I] fancy our chances
STR-1:

KEY-526217: They've got a tremendous manager, someone [%person#1-I] look up to, and it's going to be really interesting for [%person#1-me] to go up against [%person#2-him]
STR-1:

KEY-526218: [%person#1-I] can only hope to be as good as [%person#2] one day, but [%person#1-I]'m looking forward to the test
STR-1:

KEY-526219: Do [%person#1-you] feel the pressure a little more ahead of a match against a fierce rival like [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-526220: Is there more pressure on [%person#1-you] to perform in a big match against a rival like [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-526221: [%person#1-I] treat every match the same and [%person#1-I] think it's going to be business as usual as far as we're concerned
STR-1:

KEY-526222: [%person#1-I] try to block out all the noise and treat each match as business as usual
STR-1:

KEY-526223: We're approaching this game just like we would any other, but we have players who thrive in the big occasions, so we can look forward to that
STR-1:

KEY-526224: [%person#1-I] have a squad of players who enjoy playing on the bigger stage and [%person#1-I] think that can only benefit us
STR-1:

KEY-526225: It's all about desire for [%person#1-me]; do we want to win more than they do?
STR-1:

KEY-526226: We have to show them that we want to win more than they do. All the talk about tactics and systems go out of the window at times like this
STR-1:

KEY-526227: Of course there's added pressure, and the nerves that come with it; for us, we have to make sure we handle our business as best we can
STR-1:

KEY-526228: There's always pressure, but it's more intense in a match like this, and we have to show that we can handle that
STR-1:

KEY-526229: Is [%person#2] able to handle the pressure as well as [%person#1-you]?
STR-1:

KEY-526230: [%person#1-You] rarely seem to be affected by the pressure of these matches; is that the case for [%person#2] too?
STR-1:

KEY-526231: [%person#1-I] don't think either of us are likely to be too concerned by the pressure, it's the nature of the job to put it to one side
STR-1:

KEY-526232: [%person#1-I] know [%person#2-first], and [%person#1-I]'d be very surprised if [%person#2-he] suddenly started to let the pressure get to [%person#2-him]?
STR-1:

KEY-526233: [%person#1-I] know [%person#1-I] can handle the pressure but [%person#1-I] don't know about [%person#2-him]
STR-1:

KEY-526234: It's not for [%person#1-me] to comment on that, you'll have to ask [%person#2-him]
STR-1:

KEY-526235: [%person#2-He] might give the impression that [%person#2-he] can handle the pressure but [%person#1-I]'m not so sure
STR-1:

KEY-526236: [%person#1-I] sense that they won't deal with the pressure well as a team. [%person#1-I] guess we'll find out!
STR-1:

KEY-526237: We're going to give them everything we've got and then we'll see how well they all deal with the pressure
STR-1:

KEY-526238: Why do [%person#1-you] have such a good record against [%person#2]?
STR-1:

KEY-526239: What is it that has given [%person#1-you] such a good record against [%person#2]?
STR-1:

KEY-526240: [%person#1-I]'m a better manager than [%person#2-he] is
STR-1:

KEY-526241: [%person#1-I] think [%person#1-I]'m a better manager than [%person#2-him]. It sounds harsh but [%person#1-I] think the stats bear it out
STR-1:

KEY-526242: [%person#1-I] understand how [%person#2-he] wants to play and [%person#1-I]'ve got a good idea how to counter it
STR-1:

KEY-526243: [%person#2-He] has a clearly identifiable style and [%person#1-I] have a solid grasp of how to go about exploiting the weaknesses in that approach
STR-1:

KEY-526244: [%person#1-I] don't know to be honest, [%person#1-I]'m sure there's some luck involved, but [%person#1-I]'d never take the record for granted
STR-1:

KEY-526245: [%person#1-I] guess [%person#1-I]'ve been really lucky; [%person#2-he]'s proven that [%person#2-he]'s a good manager, so [%person#1-I] can't really explain it
STR-1:

KEY-526246: [%person#1-I] don't pay much attention to those sorts of records; the past is the past and the only match that matters is the next one
STR-1:

KEY-526247: [%person#1-I]'m only concerned with the future, and our next meeting is the only one that matters. The past is over and done with
STR-1:

KEY-526248: How much more work do [%person#1-you] have to do to be ready for a match like this?
STR-1:

KEY-526249: The fans in particular really want to win these matches; how much harder does that make [%person#2-your] job?
STR-1:

KEY-526250: These matches excite [%person#1-me]; they're why [%person#1-I] got into football, and [%person#1-I] can't wait for kick-off
STR-1:

KEY-526251: If [%person#1-my] players and [%person#1-I] can't get excited for this match then we're in the wrong business
STR-1:

KEY-526252: We know what's at stake, so we've prepared even more than usual. We're ready
STR-1:

KEY-526253: [%person#1-I] think we've prepared very well and [%person#1-I]'m confident we'll be able anything they throw at us
STR-1:

KEY-526254: [%person#1-My] job is pretty easy ahead of matches like this; we have to show the desire to earn the win, simple
STR-1:

KEY-526255: [%person#1-I]'ve told the players they have to be prepared to fight and show they want it more. That's what it's going to take
STR-1:

KEY-526256: These matches can stir all sorts of emotions so [%person#1-I] need to make sure [%person#1-my] players are relaxed, confident and ready to play
STR-1:

KEY-526257: It's about making sure that we're in the right state of mind to take on the challenge of this sort of match. We can't be nervous
STR-1:

KEY-526258: [%person#1-You] seem to be handling the pressure that surrounds this sort of match quite well; can [%person#2] say the same?
STR-1:

KEY-526259: Do [%person#1-you] think [%person#2] is handling the pressure around this match as well as [%person#1-you] seem to be?
STR-1:

KEY-526260: [%person#1-I] don't think it's any of [%person#1-my] business how [%person#2-he] handles things. [%person#1-I]'m focused on our work
STR-1:

KEY-526261: [%person#1-I] don't want to get drawn into that; [%person#1-I]'m only focused on doing our jobs as best we can
STR-1:

KEY-526262: [%person#1-I] think [%person#2-he]'s very capable of handling the pressure, otherwise [%person#2-he] wouldn't be where [%person#2-he] is
STR-1:

KEY-526263: [%person#1-I] can see why people would have their doubts about [%person#2-him] and it's up to us to capitalise
STR-1:

KEY-526264: [%person#2-He] does seem to be vulnerable and [%person#1-I] hope we can capitalise on signs of weakness
STR-1:

KEY-526265: We want to win this match and [%person#1-I] have to wonder if they're up for it as much as we are
STR-1:

KEY-526266: [%person#1-I] really have to question whether they want it as much as we do, and that desire comes from the manager
STR-1:

KEY-526267: Can [%person#1-you] talk about the challenges of preparing for a match against such an experienced team like [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-526268: Considering how much experience [%person#2] has to call on in [%person#2-his] squad, how challenging is it for [%person#1-you] to prepare for a match against them?
STR-1:

KEY-526269: They have a brilliant squad who know how to get the result they need. We've got our work cut out for sure
STR-1:

KEY-526270: [%person#1-I] think it's going to be very hard for us to get a result against an experienced squad who know how to get the job done
STR-1:

KEY-526271: We have to look at taking advantage of whatever we can and [%person#1-I] hope we have the physical edge against a team that might not have as much in the tank
STR-1:

KEY-526272: What they have in experience, they might now lack in physical capacity, and hopefully we can take the advantage in that regard
STR-1:

KEY-526273: [%person#1-I] think they're an old team nowadays and we fancy our chances of showing them what younger legs can do
STR-1:

KEY-526274: [%person#1-I] think they look like an old team and we certainly haven't got anything to fear
STR-1:

KEY-526275: It's a youngsters' game these days and we're going to run rings around them
STR-1:

KEY-526276: We have the advantage of youth and we're going to run rings around them, [%person#1-I]'m sure
STR-1:

KEY-526277: How did [%person#1-you] feel when [%person#2] said [%person#2-he] was interested in signing [%male#3]?
STR-1:

KEY-526278: Do [%person#1-you] have anything to say to [%person#2] after [%person#2-his] admission of interest in signing [%male#3]?
STR-1:

KEY-526279: We all know how this business works; [%person#1-I]'ll talk to anyone about a deal if it's the right thing to do
STR-1:

KEY-526280: [%person#1-I]'ll always answer [%person#2-his] calls and see if we can come to an agreement that works for everyone
STR-1:

KEY-526281: [%person#1-I]'ve learned enough to never rule anything out. Let's see what happens
STR-1:

KEY-526282: [%person#1-I]'m sure lots of managers are interested in our best players. [%person#1-I] certainly won't rule anything out right now
STR-1:

KEY-526283: [%person#1-I] have a lot of time for [%person#2-first] but [%person#1-I] won't be selling [%male#3-first] to him
STR-1:

KEY-526284: [%person#1-I]'m sure [%person#2-he] is interested, but [%person#1-I]'m not going to sell
STR-1:

KEY-526285: He's not for sale, period
STR-1:

KEY-526286: [%person#1-I] won't even pick up the phone; he's not for sale
STR-1:

KEY-526287: [%person#1-I] suspect that [%person#1-my] claims have been ignored so [%person#1-I] might have to accept defeat
STR-1:

KEY-526288: With every decision we make, we ask ourselves if it satisfies the long-term criteria we're working towards. He's going to be a big part of our journey towards success
STR-1:

KEY-526289: Will [%male#2] leave before the window closes later?
STR-1:

KEY-526290: Are we to expect any movement with [%male#2] before the window slams shut later on?
STR-1:

KEY-526291: [%person#1-I] think it looks increasingly clear that he'll be leaving, yeah
STR-1:

KEY-526292: [%person#1-I]'d be surprised if a deal wasn't done before the deadline, yeah
STR-1:

KEY-526293: If the right deal comes along then we'll be open to it
STR-1:

KEY-526294: We're open for business and, if the right offer comes along, [%person#1-I] expect we'll see where it goes
STR-1:

KEY-526295: [%person#1-I] don't want to sell so, if someone is interested, they'll have to make it very worth our while
STR-1:

KEY-526296: [%person#1-I]'ve no desire to sell him so it'd take a really really good offer for us to even consider it
STR-1:

KEY-526297: He's going nowhere, end of
STR-1:

KEY-526298: [%person#1-I] don't care who's interested in buying him because [%person#1-I]'m not interested in selling
STR-1:

KEY-526299: Is [%male#2] likely to leave the club on loan or do [%person#1-you] expect him to stay?
STR-1:

KEY-526300: [%male#2] has been rumoured with a loan move away from the club. Can [%person#1-you] shed any light on that?
STR-1:

KEY-526301: We feel his development could be best served by getting playing time under his belt elsewhere. Nothing is confirmed yet but we're hoping to confirm a deal soon
STR-1:

KEY-526302: [%person#1-I] believe he'll go out on loan imminently. A deal is close and all that is left is to dot the i's and cross the t's
STR-1:

KEY-526303: We've touted his services to other clubs and hopefully we can find him a loan move but there is currently no deal in place
STR-1:

KEY-526304: [%person#1-I]'m keen for him to be playing regular minutes and we can't currently offer that to him here. We're hoping to get something over the line soon
STR-1:

KEY-526305: [%person#1-I]'m keen to keep [%male#2-surname] around the squad for now so he won't be leaving on loan
STR-1:

KEY-526306: He's part of my thoughts for the upcoming season. [%person#1-I] feel he'll benefit most by learning from the group of players we have at the club
STR-1:

KEY-526307: He'll be remaining at the club.[%person#1-I] feel he'll improve most by learning from our senior pros in training every day
STR-1:

KEY-526308: [%person#1-I]'m not too sure on your sources. He's part of my first-team plans so there's no chance he leaves
STR-1:

KEY-526309: Will [%person#1-you] be able to beat the deadline and sign [%male#2] in time?
STR-1:

KEY-526310: Do [%person#1-you] think [%person#1-you]'ll be able to get a deal for [%male#2] done before the deadline?
STR-1:

KEY-526311: [%person#1-surname] confident of [%male#2-surname] deal
STR-1:

KEY-526312: [%person#1-surname] believes [%male#2-surname] deal should get done
STR-1:

KEY-526313: [%person#1-surname] uncertain about [%male#2-surname] deal
STR-1:

KEY-526314: [%person#1-surname] doubts [%team#1-short] will strike [%male#2-surname] deal in time
STR-1:

KEY-526315: [%person#1-I]'m really not sure to be honest, it could go either way
STR-1:

KEY-526316: [%person#1-I] think we're far enough along that the deal should get done
STR-1:

KEY-526317: [%person#1-I]'m confident; we haven't got many more details left to finalise
STR-1:

KEY-526318: There's still a fair bit to do but [%person#1-I] think we'll get there
STR-1:

KEY-526319: [%person#1-I] think we should get over the line but it'll be close
STR-1:

KEY-526320: [%person#1-I] don't know; [%person#1-my] sense is that we're going to find it hard though
STR-1:

KEY-526321: If [%person#1-I] had to commit either way right now [%person#1-I]'d say it was unlikely, but we'll see
STR-1:

KEY-526322: [%person#1-I] think we'll probably run out of time, unfortunately
STR-1:

KEY-526323: [%person#1-I] don't think it's all going to come together in time, which is a shame
STR-1:

KEY-526324: Will [%person#1-you] be able to beat the deadline and get a deal done to sell [%male#2] in time?
STR-1:

KEY-526325: Do [%person#1-you] think [%person#1-you]'ll be able to get a deal to sell [%male#2] done before the deadline?
STR-1:

KEY-526326: Will [%person#1-you] perhaps try to sign [%male#2] on loan rather than arrange a permanent deal, given the time constraints?
STR-1:

KEY-526327: Would a loan move for [%male#2] make more sense than a permanent deal considering how little time is left before the deadline?
STR-1:

KEY-526328: [%person#1-surname] hints at loan deal for [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-526329: [%person#1-surname] pushing for [%male#2-surname] loan
STR-1:

KEY-526330: [%person#1-surname] aiming for permanent [%male#2-surname] deal
STR-1:

KEY-526331: [%person#1-surname] determined to strike permanent deal for [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-526332: [%person#1-I]'m keeping all [%person#1-my] options open for the time being
STR-1:

KEY-526333: [%person#1-I] think we'll have to go down the loan route right now, yes
STR-1:

KEY-526334: [%person#1-I] expect we'll come to an agreement on a loan, maybe with the option to do something more permanent at a later date
STR-1:

KEY-526335: The longer this goes on, the more likely it seems that we'll have to do a loan deal
STR-1:

KEY-526336: It's becoming clearer that we'll need to give a loan heavy consideration really
STR-1:

KEY-526337: [%person#1-I]'d still prefer to wrap up this deal permanently if we can
STR-1:

KEY-526338: [%person#1-I] don't want to do a loan move unless we have to; we've still got time to get a permanent deal done
STR-1:

KEY-526339: [%person#1-I]'m determined to get this deal done properly
STR-1:

KEY-526340: [%person#1-I] won't be deterred because of time; we want to do this permanently and we're working to make that happen
STR-1:

KEY-526341: What do [%person#1-you] say to those who claim that [%male#2] is a classic deadline day 'panic buy'?
STR-1:

KEY-526342: Do [%person#1-you] think there's any truth in the suggestion that the [%male#2] deal is the latest panic buy on deadline day?
STR-1:

KEY-526343: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] is not a panic buy
STR-1:

KEY-526344: [%person#1-surname]: We didn't panic
STR-1:

KEY-526345: [%person#1-surname] hopes [%male#2-surname] proves worth
STR-1:

KEY-526346: [%person#1-surname] wants to see what [%male#2-surname] can do
STR-1:

KEY-526347: [%person#1-I] don't even know what to say in response to that!
STR-1:

KEY-526348: He is absolutely not a panic buy. We've wanted to sign him for a long time and [%person#1-I]'m delighted we've done that
STR-1:

KEY-526349: [%person#1-I] can't believe people would suggest that he's a panic buy. They don't know the work we've put in to get this done
STR-1:

KEY-526350: We haven't panicked. This move has been a long time in the making
STR-1:

KEY-526351: Anyone claiming we've panicked is only showing themselves up as being ill-informed. We've been thorough and we're happy with our business
STR-1:

KEY-526352: [%person#1-I] suppose [%person#1-I] can see why people would think that, but [%person#1-I] hope he quickly proves his worth and proves people wrong
STR-1:

KEY-526353: People will think whatever they want; [%person#1-I] can't change that, but [%person#1-I] do hope he quickly proves them wrong
STR-1:

KEY-526354: Sometimes you have to take a chance on deadline day and [%person#1-I]'m very keen to see what he can do for us
STR-1:

KEY-526355: [%person#1-I]'ll readily admit that deadline day means you have to make quick decisions; let's see what he can do in {an}[%team#1-short] shirt before judging him
STR-1:

KEY-526356: Can we assume that a deal to bring [%male#2] in means [%male#3] is on the way out the door?
STR-1:

KEY-526357: Does [%male#2]{s} impending arrival mean [%male#3] is heading for the exit door?
STR-1:

KEY-526358: [%person#1-surname] expects [%male#3-surname] to leave
STR-1:

KEY-526359: [%person#1-surname] hints at [%male#3-surname] departure
STR-1:

KEY-526360: [%person#1-surname] hopes to keep [%male#3-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-526361: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#3-surname] is going nowhere
STR-1:

KEY-526362: [%person#1-I] won't be drawn on any speculation right now, [%person#1-I]'m too busy
STR-1:

KEY-526363: [%person#1-I] think that's fair, we have some business to take care of
STR-1:

KEY-526364: [%person#1-I]'d say that's a fair assessment; we've had to act because we're expecting him to leave
STR-1:

KEY-526365: There are still some details to work through but, yes, it's likely going to be a case of one in and one out
STR-1:

KEY-526366: In an ideal world we'd be adding to the squad without taking away but, right now, [%person#1-I] think we're looking at [%male#3-first] leaving us
STR-1:

KEY-526367: [%person#1-I]'m hopeful we can keep them both at the club and be stronger for it, but we'll have to wait and see
STR-1:

KEY-526368: [%person#1-I] wouldn't say that's a safe assumption to make; we'd like for [%male#3-first] to stay
STR-1:

KEY-526369: Absolutely not, we're not in the business of selling our best players and so [%male#2-first]{s} arrival is only going to strengthen us
STR-1:

KEY-526370: [%male#3-first] isn't going anywhere so, no, we're not signing anyone to replace him
STR-1:

KEY-526371: How has this transfer window affected [%person#1-your] plans for the rest of the season?
STR-1:

KEY-526372: How do [%person#1-you] feel this transfer window has set [%person#1-you] up for the rest of the season?
STR-1:

KEY-526373: [%person#1-surname] aiming for strong finish to season
STR-1:

KEY-526374: [%person#1-surname] hopes [%team#1-short] have improved
STR-1:

KEY-526375: [%person#1-surname] keen to make progress
STR-1:

KEY-526376: [%person#1-surname] unsure about rest of the season
STR-1:

KEY-526377: [%person#1-I] guess we're about to find out!
STR-1:

KEY-526378: [%person#1-I] think we've set ourselves up for a really strong finish to the season
STR-1:

KEY-526379: [%person#1-I] like to think we're in a better position to finish the season really strongly
STR-1:

KEY-526380: If we can show that we've managed to improve then [%person#1-I] think that's a job well done
STR-1:

KEY-526381: [%person#1-I]'m hopeful that we can show an improvement on and off the pitch that takes us closer to our long-term goals
STR-1:

KEY-526382: It's all about progress for [%person#1-me]. It might not show right away but, as long as we're moving forward, [%person#1-I]'m happy
STR-1:

KEY-526383: We need to show that we're making progress. Now's the time for us to prove that
STR-1:

KEY-526384: [%person#1-I] don't know how the rest of the season will go; [%person#1-I] only wish [%person#1-I] was more certain
STR-1:

KEY-526385: [%person#1-I] reckon we could've done more during this window and [%person#1-I]'m unsure what the immediate future now holds
STR-1:

KEY-526386: Having enjoyed a good season so far, are [%person#1-you] looking to use deadline day to improve the squad and go from strength to strength?
STR-1:

KEY-526387: Will [%person#1-you] be using this deadline day to try to capitalise on a good season so far and make [%person#1-your] squad even better?
STR-1:

KEY-526388: [%person#1-surname] wants to strike while iron is hot
STR-1:

KEY-526389: [%person#1-surname] keen to improve [%team#1-short] squad
STR-1:

KEY-526390: [%person#1-surname] happy to stay patient
STR-1:

KEY-526391: [%person#1-surname] taking measured approach to [%team#1-short]{s} season
STR-1:

KEY-526392: Let's see what the day brings, shall we?
STR-1:

KEY-526393: [%person#1-I] think we need to keep the momentum going and, if we can bring in proven quality, [%person#1-I]'d like to be able to do that
STR-1:

KEY-526394: We've built up some momentum here and it's important to [%person#1-me] that we do whatever we can to maintain that
STR-1:

KEY-526395: [%person#1-I]'m always looking to improve the squad, especially if it helps us to keep the good times rolling
STR-1:

KEY-526396: If the opportunity arises to add to the squad and improve our chances further still, [%person#1-I]'ll try to take it
STR-1:

KEY-526397: [%person#1-I]'m happy to stay patient and see what happens. We're in a good place right now and we don't need to force anything
STR-1:

KEY-526398: [%person#1-I]'ll stay patient and see what happens. Things are going well and [%person#1-I] don't want to mess that up by acting rashly
STR-1:

KEY-526399: We've put ourselves in a strong position through careful and considerate management and [%person#1-I] don't think we need to change that on today of all days
STR-1:

KEY-526400: [%person#1-I] prefer a more measured approach; why would we deviate from what has worked so well for us this far?
STR-1:

KEY-526401: Is deadline day the perfect opportunity to kick-start a disappointing season by bringing in some reinforcements?
STR-1:

KEY-526402: Are [%person#1-you] aiming to strengthen the squad today to breathe new life into a season that has disappointed many so far?
STR-1:

KEY-526403: [%person#1-surname] wants [%team#1-short] to improve
STR-1:

KEY-526404: [%person#1-surname] hopes to help [%team#1-short] turn things around
STR-1:

KEY-526405: [%person#1-surname]: Panic buys won't help us
STR-1:

KEY-526406: [%person#1-surname] refuses to hit panic button
STR-1:

KEY-526407: [%person#1-I] know everyone wants to see us do something but [%person#1-I]'d ask for patience. None of us know how deadline day will unfold
STR-1:

KEY-526408: We need to do something so [%person#1-I]'d keep an eye on what we do for sure
STR-1:

KEY-526409: [%person#1-I] think it's clear we need to improve so we'll try to do some business to facilitate that
STR-1:

KEY-526410: [%person#1-I]'d hope we're able to do something to change our fortunes
STR-1:

KEY-526411: [%person#1-I]'d like it if we were able to strike a deal or two to give us some more options, yeah
STR-1:

KEY-526412: [%person#1-I]'m open for business but [%person#1-I] don't think panic buys are going to do us any good at all
STR-1:

KEY-526413: We need to be careful not to sign players for the sake of it; panic buys aren't what we need
STR-1:

KEY-526414: [%person#1-I]'m not going to hit the panic button; we can turn things around in other more sensible ways
STR-1:

KEY-526415: [%person#1-I]'m not too worried about how things are going, and hitting the panic button is the last thing [%person#1-I]'m going to do
STR-1:

KEY-526416: Having been linked with [%male#2] throughout this transfer window, will [%person#1-you] finally get a deal done today?
STR-1:

KEY-526417: Are [%person#1-you] hopeful of finally signing [%male#2] today after being linked with him throughout this transfer window?

STR-1:

KEY-526421: [%person#1-surname] doesn't expect deal for [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-526422: [%person#1-I] wish [%person#1-I] could say for sure but [%person#1-I] really don't know
STR-1:

KEY-526423: We've obviously been after him for a while and we'll be trying to get that one done before the deadline
STR-1:

KEY-526424: Everyone knows we're in for him and [%person#1-I]'d like to think we can finally get it sorted today
STR-1:

KEY-526425: [%person#1-I]'d like to sign him and we'll be doing our best to make that happen
STR-1:

KEY-526426: He's someone we'd like to bring in and we'll do our best to finalise a deal today
STR-1:

KEY-526427: We haven't been able to come to an agreement yet and [%person#1-I] don't think that's going to change today
STR-1:

KEY-526428: We seem to be at an impasse in terms of striking a deal so [%person#1-I] wouldn't be too hopeful of a deal suddenly coming together today
STR-1:

KEY-526429: Don't hold your breath, it seems unlikely to happen today
STR-1:

KEY-526430: [%person#1-I]'ve not been given any reason to think we'll do that deal today
STR-1:

KEY-526431: It seems unlikely that [%person#1-you]'ll be able to sign [%male#2] at this stage; will [%person#1-you] go back in for him at a later date?
STR-1:

KEY-526432: With time running out on the chances of signing [%male#2] today, will [%person#1-you] still be looking to bring him in at the next opportunity?
STR-1:

KEY-526433: [%person#1-surname] expects [%male#2-surname] to become {an}[%team#1-short] player
STR-1:

KEY-526434: [%person#1-surname] believes [%team#1-short] will sign [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-526435: [%person#1-surname] casts doubt on [%male#2-surname] deal
STR-1:

KEY-526436: [%person#1-surname] rules out [%male#2-surname] transfer
STR-1:

KEY-526437: Who knows what the future holds? We'll have to wait and see
STR-1:

KEY-526438: [%person#1-I] think we'll get it done, yeah. Good things come to those who wait
STR-1:

KEY-526439: We're not suddenly going to lose interest in him because of a deadline today. [%person#1-I]'d expect the deal to happen eventually
STR-1:

KEY-526440: [%person#1-I] like to think he'll be our player eventually, we're prepared to be patient
STR-1:

KEY-526441: We've wanted him for a long time and [%person#1-I] choose to believe that he will end up signing for us
STR-1:

KEY-526442: [%person#1-I] don't know what to think; football changes so quickly that it might not be a signing that suits us come the next window
STR-1:

KEY-526443: Things can change so quickly in this business so [%person#1-I] don't know if we'll be in a position to sign him come the next transfer window
STR-1:

KEY-526444: It's now or never for [%person#1-me]. We'll need to move on if it doesn't happen
STR-1:

KEY-526445: If we can't sign him now, [%person#1-I] don't think we'll sign him at all
STR-1:

KEY-526446: [%person#1-Your] hopes of signing [%male#2] appear to be contingent on a number of other deals happening. Are [%person#1-you] confident it'll all come together?
STR-1:

KEY-526447: Will [%person#1-you] get a deal for [%male#2] sorted given that it seems to be a part of a transfer chain where all the other deals need to happen too?
STR-1:

KEY-526448: [%person#1-surname] optimistic about signing [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-526449: [%person#1-surname] hoping to sign [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-526450: [%person#1-surname] casts doubt over [%male#2-surname] deal
STR-1:

KEY-526451: [%person#1-surname] fears [%male#2-surname] deal will fall through
STR-1:

KEY-526452: It's too early to say, there's still a long way to go
STR-1:

KEY-526453: Everyone wants to get their players signed and sealed so [%person#1-I]'m optimistic
STR-1:

KEY-526454: [%person#1-I] like to think it'll happen, we're all trying our best to sign the players we want
STR-1:

KEY-526455: [%person#1-I] hope so, as long as we're professional [%person#1-I] don't see why it won't happen
STR-1:

KEY-526456: [%person#1-I]'m hopeful; it's more likely than unlikely
STR-1:

KEY-526457: [%person#1-I]'m really unsure to tell you the truth; so much of it is out of [%person#1-my] hands
STR-1:

KEY-526458: [%person#1-I] can't control what's happening elsewhere so [%person#1-I] have [%person#1-my] doubts
STR-1:

KEY-526459: [%person#1-I] think it'll fall apart, unfortunately. If all of these deals were going to happen they would've been finalised by now
STR-1:

KEY-526460: It only takes one deal to fall apart for the entire chain to collapse so [%person#1-I] fear we're in for disappointment
STR-1:

KEY-526461: Given that [%person#1-you]'re up against the clock, are we likely to see [%person#1-you] submit a deal sheet for [%male#2]?
STR-1:

KEY-526462: Will [%person#1-you] need to submit appropriate paperwork to allow the [%male#2] signing to be processed after hours?

STR-1:

KEY-526467: [%person#1-I] won't speculate on that sort of thing at this stage
STR-1:

KEY-526468: [%person#1-I] think we'll probably need to do something that allows us to get him signed as late as is allowed, yes
STR-1:

KEY-526469: We're prepared to do this deal as late as possible so [%person#1-I] would say that's quite likely
STR-1:

KEY-526470: [%person#1-I]'m sure this one will go down to the wire so we'll do whatever's necessary
STR-1:

KEY-526471: If we need to submit late paperwork to get him signed, we'll do that
STR-1:

KEY-526472: [%person#1-I]'m not planning on things running that close to the deadline right now
STR-1:

KEY-526473: [%person#1-I]'m not too sure about that, we'll try to sort everything out within the normal time frame
STR-1:

KEY-526474: If we can't get him signed before the deadline, [%person#1-I] doubt we'll push for it to happen right at the very end
STR-1:

KEY-526475: [%person#1-I]'m not sure we'll go to that extent to sign him
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-526481: [%person#1-surname]: [%team#1-short] abided by rules
STR-1:

KEY-526482: [%person#1-I] don't know what the time was, it wasn't [%person#1-my] main focus
STR-1:

KEY-526483: It was a late one, let's leave it at that!
STR-1:

KEY-526484: All [%person#1-I]'m prepared to say is that it was definitely a late one!
STR-1:

KEY-526485: It was pretty close to the deadline, that's all [%person#1-I] know
STR-1:

KEY-526486: We were definitely cutting it fine, whether it was before or after the deadline [%person#1-I] don't know, but we're assured it's all approved
STR-1:

KEY-526487: We signed him in time as far as [%person#1-I]'m aware
STR-1:

KEY-526488: We were told we signed him in time and that's good enough for [%person#1-me]
STR-1:

KEY-526489: We abided by the rules at all times and [%person#1-I]'m really happy to get the deal done
STR-1:

KEY-526490: [%person#1-I] know we followed the rules throughout and it's a great feeling to have him signed
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-526492: Are [%person#1-you] confident that [%person#1-you] have [%person#1-your] squad finalised considering the [%comp#1-short] registration deadline also falls on today's date?

STR-1:

KEY-526494: [%person#1-surname] confident [%team#1-short] squad is finalised
STR-1:

KEY-526495: [%person#1-surname] considering late squad changes
STR-1:

KEY-526496: [%person#1-surname]: [%team#1-short] squad could change late on
STR-1:

KEY-526497: We'll soon see, there's still time for anything to happen
STR-1:

KEY-526498: Yeah, we know what the squad will look like when we submit it
STR-1:

KEY-526499: We've planned everything out and [%person#1-I] know what the final squad will look like

STR-1:

KEY-526502: If there are late changes to be made, [%person#1-I]'m open to making them
STR-1:

KEY-526503: [%person#1-I]'m flexible right up until the deadline. If there's a good reason to change course, let's explore it
STR-1:

KEY-526504: [%person#1-I] fully expect things to change before we get to the deadline
STR-1:

KEY-526505: [%person#1-I] think we need to be open to anything on days like this and [%person#1-I] would certainly expect some changes
STR-1:

KEY-526506: [%person#1-You] currently have no room in [%person#1-your] squad for any deadline day additions. Will [%person#1-you] have to make a few last-minute adjustments?
STR-1:

KEY-526507: Can we expect [%person#1-you] to juggle [%person#1-your] options today as [%person#1-you] currently have no room in [%person#1-your] squad for new signings?
STR-1:

KEY-526508: [%person#1-surname] has decisions to make

STR-1:

KEY-526513: It's clear that if we want to bring someone in then [%person#1-I] have some decisions to make
STR-1:

KEY-526514: If we want to sign someone then [%person#1-I] have to make a decision on who misses out
STR-1:

KEY-526515: [%person#1-I]'m not too concerned about having to make those choices because they're part and parcel of football. If we want to sign someone, we will
STR-1:

KEY-526516: It's the nature of the beast these days; [%person#1-I] know what our squad looks like and what we have to do if we want to add to it
STR-1:

KEY-526517: [%person#1-I] don't think we're likely to do anything that requires any sort of changes at this point
STR-1:

KEY-526518: We're unlikely to bring anyone in so [%person#1-I] won't have to make those tough choices
STR-1:

KEY-526519: We're not going to do any business today, quote [%person#1-me] on that
STR-1:

KEY-526520: [%person#1-I]'m happy with our squad, we're not going to be doing anything today
STR-1:

KEY-526521: [%person#1-You] still have some room in [%person#1-your] squad; can we expect [%person#1-you] to add to it today?
STR-1:

KEY-526525: [%person#1-surname]: Quality more important than quantity
STR-1:

KEY-526526: [%person#1-surname] 'unlikely' to expand [%team#1-short] squad
STR-1:

KEY-526527: [%person#1-I] won't commit to anything right now; let's see how the day unfolds
STR-1:

KEY-526528: [%person#1-I] certainly want to give us more options, yes
STR-1:

KEY-526529: It'd be nice if we were able to bring one or two more players in to bolster our squad
STR-1:

KEY-526530: [%person#1-I] think we could do with a boost to our numbers so, if there's a deal to be done, we'll get involved
STR-1:

KEY-526531: If we can add numbers to the squad in the right way, why not?
STR-1:

KEY-526532: Quality is always more important than quantity. [%person#1-I]'ll only sign someone if they're the right fit
STR-1:

KEY-526533: [%person#1-I]'m not going to sign anyone for the sake of it. It's always got to be quality over quantity
STR-1:

KEY-526534: [%person#1-I]'m happy with [%person#1-my] squad so [%person#1-I]'d say it's unlikely that we'll bring anyone in
STR-1:

KEY-526535: We're unlikely to sign anyone; [%person#1-I]'m happy with [%person#1-my] squad as it is
STR-1:

KEY-526536: Do [%person#1-you] have confidence in [%person#2] to get the job done today?

STR-1:

KEY-526541: [%person#1-surname] hints at friction with [%person#2-surname]
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-526543: [%person#1-I] have full faith in [%person#2-first] to do right by the club
STR-1:

KEY-526544: [%person#2-First] is incredibly good at [%person#2-his] job and [%person#1-I] have the utmost faith in [%person#2-his] decisions
STR-1:

KEY-526545: [%person#1-I] believe in everyone who works for this club, [%person#2-first] included
STR-1:

KEY-526546: [%person#2-First] is [%job#1] for a reason and [%person#1-I]'m very happy with that
STR-1:

KEY-526547: [%person#2-He] certainly has work to do and it's never an easy day for anyone trying to do business
STR-1:

KEY-526548: [%person#1-I] know [%person#2-he] has a lot of work to do so let's see what happens
STR-1:

KEY-526549: [%person#1-I] hope we're on the same page when it comes to important decisions, put it that way
STR-1:

KEY-526550: [%person#2-He] has [%person#2-his] way of doing things and [%person#1-I] hope they align with what [%person#1-I] want to do
STR-1:

KEY-526551: The transfer window in [%nation#2] short closes earlier than it does in [%nation#1]. Does that make it harder for [%person#2-you] to sell [%male#2]?
STR-1:

KEY-526552: Will it be harder to sell [%male#2] because the [%nation#2-nationality] transfer window closes earlier than the [%nation#1-nationality] one?
STR-1:

KEY-526553: [%person#1-surname] believes [%male#2-surname] deal will happen
STR-1:

KEY-526555: [%person#1-surname]: Different deadlines create problems
STR-1:

KEY-526556: [%person#1-surname] criticises 'inconsistent' transfer deadlines
STR-1:

KEY-526557: [%person#1-I]'ve not really thought about it from that perspective to be honest
STR-1:

KEY-526558: [%person#1-I] don't think the time difference matters; we should be able to get a deal done
STR-1:

KEY-526559: We're pretty close to a deal there so [%person#1-I] don't think the time difference is a problem
STR-1:

KEY-526560: We might have to rush it through but [%person#1-I]'m hopeful it'll happen
STR-1:

KEY-526561: [%person#1-I] hope it happens, even if we have to rush it
STR-1:

KEY-526562: It's clear that when deadlines happen at different times it creates problems, and we'll have to work around them
STR-1:

KEY-526563: The time difference causes some problems for us and we have to work around them
STR-1:

KEY-526564: Why can't we have one time that everyone works towards? It's stupid that we have to complicate things needlessly like his
STR-1:

KEY-526565: [%person#1-I] hate the inconsistencies with when each deadline happens. It makes life so much harder
STR-1:

KEY-526566: The transfer window here is closed, but it remains open in some other countries. Does that give [%person#1-you] more options when it comes to selling players?
STR-1:

KEY-526567: Will [%person#1-you] perhaps look to take advantage of the transfer window still being open in some countries to sell one or two players?
STR-1:

KEY-526568: [%person#1-surname] could look to sell
STR-1:

KEY-526569: [%person#1-surname] considers late exits
STR-1:

KEY-526570: [%person#1-surname] doesn't want to sell anyone

KEY-526571: [%person#1-surname] rules out [%team#1-short] exits
STR-1:

KEY-526572: [%person#1-I] don't want to make any predictions. What will be, will be
STR-1:

KEY-526573: We're always open for business and, if someone comes in with an offer for one of our players, we'll consider it
STR-1:

KEY-526574: We have the flexibility to do business with clubs in places where players can still be signed, so why not?
STR-1:

KEY-526575: [%person#1-I]'m happy to talk to anyone who wants to make us an offer
STR-1:

KEY-526576: If another team wants to make us an offer, all [%person#1-I] can say is that we'll listen
STR-1:

KEY-526577: [%person#1-I] don't really want to sell anyone so [%person#1-I] don't think it's something to look out for
STR-1:

KEY-526578: [%person#1-I]'m not interested in selling anyone at this stage thank you very much
STR-1:

KEY-526579: We can't bring anyone in now, so we won't be letting anyone leave either
STR-1:

KEY-526580: We won't be selling anyone, especially because we can't make any signings to balance things out
STR-1:

KEY-526581: [%male#2] looks unlikely to get the move he so desperately wants today, so what happens next?
STR-1:

KEY-526582: What's next for [%male#2] as it looks increasingly unlikely that he'll get the move he has been angling for?
STR-1:

KEY-526585: [%male#2-surname] has to be patient, says [%person#1-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-526586: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] has to decide what's important
STR-1:

KEY-526587: [%person#1-I] really don't know what he'll do now
STR-1:

KEY-526588: As long as he remains {an}[%team#1-short] player, he needs to commit to the club, and give us everything he has
STR-1:

KEY-526589: [%person#1-I] want him to commit to being {an}[%team#1-short] player. That's the bare minimum
STR-1:

KEY-526590: He needs to act with professionalism and go about his business in the right way
STR-1:

KEY-526591: [%person#1-I] want to see professionalism and respect. Things haven't worked out for him and he has to respond in the right way
STR-1:

KEY-526592: He needs to be patient; [%person#1-I] don't know if or when he'll get his move but, for now, complaining won't help anyone
STR-1:

KEY-526593: [%person#1-I]'d ask for him to be patient; he might get his wish eventually but, until then, he's {an}[%team#1-short] player
STR-1:

KEY-526594: He has to decide what's important to him. [%person#1-I]'d like to think he's able to put this to one side for a while at the very least
STR-1:

KEY-526595: [%person#1-I] think he needs to decide what's important to him. We're going to need him to be at his best while he's here
STR-1:

KEY-526596: [%person#1-Your] hopes of selling [%male#2] appear to be contingent on a number of other deals happening. Are [%person#1-you] confident it'll all come together?
STR-1:

KEY-526597: Will [%person#1-you] get a deal to sell [%male#2] sorted given that it seems to be a part of a transfer chain where all the other deals need to happen too?
STR-1:

KEY-526598: [%person#1-surname] optimistic about selling [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-526603: [%person#1-I] like to think it'll happen, we're all trying our best
STR-1:

KEY-526604: Will [%person#1-you] perhaps try to move [%male#2] out on loan rather than arrange a permanent deal, given the time constraints?
STR-1:

KEY-526605: Would a loan move out for [%male#2] make more sense than a permanent deal considering how little time is left before the deadline?
STR-1:

KEY-526606: [%person#1-surname] hints at loan exit for [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-526607: [%person#1-surname] pushing for [%male#2-surname] loan exit

STR-1:

KEY-526618: He's such a good young player, he brings a quality we need, and [%person#1-I] think the fans will love him
STR-1:

KEY-526619: It's a really exciting deal for the club that we're able to get a young player of his calibre in. [%person#1-I] can't wait to work with him
STR-1:

KEY-526620: [%person#1-I]'m excited, and [%person#1-I] think the fans should be too. We've got a real player on our hands here
STR-1:

KEY-526621: [%person#1-I]'m happy to have him here. He's come here to learn and to take the next step in his career, and hopefully we can help him with that
STR-1:

KEY-526622: [%person#1-I] like to use the loan market where [%person#1-I] can; he's here to learn and develop and hopefully help us a bit along the way
STR-1:

KEY-526623: He's a good young player who comes here looking to prove himself a little bit. [%person#1-My] job is to help him do that while helping us on the pitch
STR-1:

KEY-526624: If he shows the quality [%person#1-I] know he has then we'll be very pleased. It's his job now to prove himself at this level
STR-1:

KEY-526625: [%person#1-You]'ve completed the season-long loan signing of [%male#2] with an option to buy. What can we expect?
STR-1:

KEY-526626: What should we expect from [%team#1-short] after completing the season-long loan of [%male#2], which comes with an option to buy?

STR-1:

KEY-526628: [%person#1-surname] hopes [%male#2-surname] has a future at [%team#2-short]
STR-1:

KEY-526629: [%person#1-surname]: We'll be patient with [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-526630: [%person#1-surname] 'doubts' [%team#1-short] will use [%male#2-surname] option
STR-1:

KEY-526631: He's a good player and [%person#1-I]'m happy to have him here
STR-1:

KEY-526632: [%person#1-I]'ve been a fan of his for some time and [%person#1-I]'d love to keep him here permanently. If it suits everyone, we'll look to trigger the option
STR-1:

KEY-526633: He's a fine player and [%person#1-I] wanted to include the option to buy to make sure we have the chance to keep him here permanently
STR-1:

KEY-526634: Right now it's just a loan but [%person#1-I] hope he gives us every reason to use the option and make him {an}[%team#1-short] player for good
STR-1:

KEY-526635: [%person#1-I] hope we get to use the option to make the deal permanent; it'd mean that he's performed to the standards we expect of him
STR-1:

KEY-526636: We'll be patient with him and see how it goes. The beauty of a loan agreement is that we have the flexibility to do what we want when it suits us
STR-1:

KEY-526637: [%person#1-I]'m pleased with the loan agreement, and now we'll be patient. The right long-term decision for the club will become clear in due course
STR-1:

KEY-526638: [%person#1-I] think it's only going to be a loan and [%person#1-I] doubt we'll be able to trigger the option, but we'll see what happens
STR-1:

KEY-526639: If [%person#1-I]'m honest [%person#1-I] doubt we'll be in a position to trigger the option, but who knows what'll happen over the course of the season

STR-1:

KEY-526676: He may be young but he can win games for us. That's why [%person#1-I] wanted him here
STR-1:

KEY-526677: He gives us options and that's really important as the season goes on. He has youth on his side and should be able to make an impact when we need him to
STR-1:

KEY-526678: The longer the season goes on, the more options [%person#1-I] want available to [%person#1-me]. He's young, hungry, and keen to make an impact
STR-1:

KEY-526679: [%person#1-I]'m cautious not to weigh him down under the burden of expectation, especially at his age. He's a good player and [%person#1-I]'m just happy to have him for the rest of the season

STR-1:

KEY-526726: [%person#1-You]'ve completed the loan signing of a talented youngster in [%male#2] on {an}[%number#1-text]-season loan with no option to buy. Can [%person#1-you] talk about what that does for [%team#1-short]?

STR-1:

KEY-526737: This is the way football is going. Loans have been a part of the transfer market for a long time but we're happy to take a long-term approach to them now
STR-1:

KEY-526738: It's a deal that works well for us because we ordinarily wouldn't be able to capture a player of his quality for this length of time. A long-term loan makes that possible
STR-1:

KEY-526739: [%person#1-I] can understand why some fans would be concerned that we're putting time into developing a player we don't own, but he will take this club forward too, don't forget that

STR-1:

KEY-526746: [%person#1-surname] urges patience as [%male#2-surname] joins on loan
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-526751: We've got him on loan for longer than some players spend at a club on a permanent basis, and we can sign him outright if we want to. He's one of us now
STR-1:

KEY-526752: There's no downside to this deal for us as [%person#1-I] see it. If he does well, we can sign him, and if he doesn't, we don't have to
STR-1:

KEY-526753: We now get to have a good, long look at a youngster we have high hopes for. If we want to sign him, we can, but we're not obliged to. There's little to no downside
STR-1:

KEY-526754: This is a long-term loan for a reason; we need to be patient, give him time to develop, and wait for him to come along at his own pace
STR-1:

KEY-526755: He's a young talent who needs time and patience if we're to see him develop into the sort of player we want to sign permanently. Let's not put too much pressure on him now
STR-1:

KEY-526756: [%person#1-You]'ve completed the loan signing of [%male#2] on {an}[%number#1-text]-season loan with no option to buy. Can [%person#1-you] talk about what that does for [%team#1-short] to do a deal for a player who is hardly one for the future?
STR-1:

KEY-526757: Can [%person#1-you] talk a little about the thought process behind bringing [%male#2] in on loan for [%number#1-text] seasons without an option to buy? He's not exactly one for the future, is he?

STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-526761: [%person#1-I] think it's a deal that helps everyone. We get a good player, [%team#2-short] are happy to move him on, and [%male#2-first] can enjoy a fresh start with us
STR-1:

KEY-526762: This is an arrangement that suits everyone. He gets a fresh start and we get a quality player who can make an immediate impact
STR-1:

KEY-526763: It's a deal that works well for us because we now get a good player without the commitment of a permanent deal. We have flexibility
STR-1:

KEY-526764: [%person#1-I] can understand why some fans would be concerned that we're entering into a long-term loan for a player like [%male#2-first] but [%person#1-I]'d ask them to trust the process
STR-1:

KEY-526765: People might think we're doing [%team#2-short] a favour and taking a player they don't want off their hands, but [%person#1-I] think he'll be able to help us achieve our objectives, if he's just given a chance
STR-1:

KEY-526766: [%person#1-You]'ve completed the loan signing of the experienced [%male#2] on {an}[%number#1-text]-season loan with the option to buy. Can [%person#1-you] talk about what that does for [%team#1-short]?

KEY-526768: [%person#1-I] really am delighted. We've got a proven player in on loan for a good length of time and we can sign him any time we want to. What's not to like?
STR-1:

KEY-526769: This is the perfect deal! We've got a long-term loan and the right to sign a player who has proven himself in the game already. [%person#1-I]'m delighted!
STR-1:

KEY-526770: We now get to have a good, long look at a player who could thrive now he has a fresh start here. If we want to sign him, we can, but we're not obliged to. There's little to no downside
STR-1:

KEY-526771: This is a long-term loan for a reason; we've got a good player who will need time to settle and find his game again. Let's have some patience
STR-1:

KEY-526772: He's a player who has needed a fresh start, and we can afford to let him find his game again now he's here. Let's not put too much pressure on him now
STR-1:

KEY-526773: What did [%person#1-you] think about [%male#2]{s} late miss? That could've been the winner
STR-1:

KEY-526774: Do [%person#1-you] regret [%male#2]{s} late miss that could have secured a win?
STR-1:

KEY-526775: It was frustrating, but that's football, it happens
STR-1:

KEY-526776: Yeah [%person#1-I]'m disappointed, but there's no blame, it happens
STR-1:

KEY-526777: It sort of summed up how the match went, though there are plenty of positives we can take away

STR-1:

KEY-526781: [%person#1-I] was sure he was going to score and [%person#1-I] still can't believe he didn't
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-526792: It's probably not the ideal circumstances for him but we'll do our best to put him in the best possible position to do well, 'we are where we are' is an expression of the current moment

He is the last line of defence and is relied upon to help the team keep clean sheets.\n\nThe Goalkeeper can distribute the ball in many ways. He can pass it short to his defenders, try to play out of defence, or he could play longer passes towards a target forward or a wide player.
STR-1:

KEY-526802: The 'Segundo Volante' is different from the Deep-Lying Playmaker in that their role is primarily a defensive one best suited to being paired with an Anchor, and is also different from the Ball-Winning Midfielder, in that they often run with the ball, or arrive with a late run, into the opposition area in much the same way a Box-to-Box Central Midfielder does.
STR-1:

KEY-526803: A Target Forward can transform an average team into a good one by using sheer physicality to disrupt the opposition's defence and open space for a striker partner and supporting midfielders.\n\nThe Target Forward uses strength and aerial presence to bring teammates into play rather than relying on technical ability.
STR-1:

KEY-526804: A Complete Forward possesses all the technical attributes of a Deep-Lying Forward, the goal scoring ability of a Poacher and the strength and power of a Target Forward.\n\nEqually adept at playing in others, fashioning chances and getting on the end of team moves, such a player transcends tactical instruction and should simply be allowed to do their own thing.
STR-1:

KEY-526805: Sometimes referred to as the 'Water Carrier', the Anchor's main duty is to sit in the hole between the defence and the midfield, intercepting moves, winning the ball and laying off simple passes to more creative teammates.\n\nSince the key job is to anchor the defence, the Anchor doesn't venture too far from their position either to close down the opposition or to support the more advanced players.
STR-1:

KEY-526806: The Wide Target Forward will be the main outlet for clearances and long balls from the back. Ideally positioned against a smaller and weaker full-back, they will be asked to get hold of the ball and keep it before recycling it to a team-mate.
STR-1:

KEY-526807: With an Attack Duty, the Wide Target Forward will be the main focal point for the team and the outlet for the majority of their attacking play. Ideally positioned against a smaller and weaker full-back, they will be asked to receive the ball in attacking areas and make their presence felt to bring team-mates into play in the attacking third.
STR-1:

KEY-526808: With a Support duty, the Wide Target Forward is best used for relocating a tall and powerful target to bully a smaller, weaker full-back, offering knock-downs and opportunities to on-rushing central players.
STR-1:

KEY-526809: With a Support duty, the Target Forward will look to win flick-ons and play simple possession passes to teammates to bring them into play.
STR-1:

KEY-526810: With an Attack Duty, the Target Forward will lead the line and open space for teammates to move into.
STR-1:

KEY-526811: The Anchor is only available with a Defend duty.
STR-1:

KEY-526812: Player

KEY-526818: Trigger Press Much Less Often
STR-1:

KEY-526819: Distribute to Target Forward
STR-1:

KEY-526820: This increases the likelihood of the team triggering the press to much more often; they will seek to disrupt play at almost every opportunity.
STR-1:

KEY-526821: This increases the likelihood of the team triggering the press to more often; they will look to disrupt play more often than not.
STR-1:

KEY-526822: This reduces the likelihood of the team triggering the press to less often; they will instead be more patient and choose their moments wisely.
STR-1:

KEY-526823: This reduces the likelihood of the team triggering the press to much less often; they will instead be very patient and wait for a clear chance to disrupt the opposition's play.
STR-1:

KEY-526824: Distribute to Target Forward asks the goalkeeper to primarily seek out the team's designated target in attack when distributing the ball from possession.
STR-1:

KEY-526825: Cross Aim Target Forward
STR-1:

KEY-526826: A More Urgent Pressing Intensity means the team will be more eager to trigger a press. Each player's attributes determine the intensity of the press they are able to apply.
STR-1:

KEY-526827: A Less Urgent Pressing Intensity means the team will be more patient when it comes to pressing, waiting for the right opportunity to engage with the opponent.
STR-1:

KEY-526828: This option asks players to deliver their crosses in the general direction of a designated target forward.
STR-1:

KEY-526830: If hired, [%person#1-I] would like the board to consider turning the club professional, as [%person#1-I] feel this will help us attract better players.
STR-1:

KEY-526831: If hired, [%person#1-I] would like the board to consider turning the club semi-professional, as [%person#1-I] feel this will help attract better players.

KEY-526833: There is nothing [%person#2-you] can say that will make me believe this is anything other than a terrible mistake on [%person#2-your] part.
STR-1:

KEY-526834: If the team performs better then it's just something I have to deal with.
STR-1:

KEY-526835: I've had some trouble settling in here but we don't need to talk about that now.
STR-1: Tôi đã gặp một số khó khăn khi ở đây nhưng chúng ta không cần phải nói về điều đó bây gì về nó nữa.

KEY-526836: I don't think my contract has anything to do with it and [%person#2-you]'re using it as an excuse. I don't want to miss out on the move of a lifetime.
STR-1: Tôi không nghĩ rằng hợp đồng của tôi có liên quan gì đến nó và [%person#2-you] đang sử dụng nó như một cái cớ. Tôi không muốn bỏ lỡ bước chuyển của cuộc đời.

KEY-526837: [%person#2-You]'re right, I'll follow [%male#5-first]'s example, sorry boss.
STR-1:

KEY-526838: [%person#1-I]'m more than willing to heap the pressure on so we can find out. [%person#1-I] have [%person#1-my] doubts
STR-1:

KEY-526839: How did [%person#1-you] feel upon hearing that [%male#2] had dedicated his [%award#1] win to [%person#1-you]?
STR-1:

KEY-526840: With [%male#2] returning from his loan at [%team#2-short], are [%person#1-you] planning on unleashing him into the first team?
STR-1:

KEY-526841: He knows he should've scored it and he'll absolutely be working twice as hard to make up for it next time
STR-1:

KEY-526842: [%person#1-I]'ve had the privilege to know [%person#2-him] as a person and a coach. [%person#2-He]'s someone who is admired throughout football
STR-1:

KEY-526843: [%person#2-He]'s not someone who interests [%person#1-me]. [%person#2-He] doesn't matter to [%person#1-me] at all
STR-1:

KEY-526844: [%person#2-He]'s not [%person#1-my] cup of tea. [%person#1-I] don't actually like tea but, if [%person#1-I] did, [%person#1-I] imagine [%person#2-his] kind of tea would leave a very bitter taste in the mouth
STR-1:

KEY-526845: [%person#1-I] think we've got such a strong squad that, whatever team [%person#1-I] pick, we're going to give you a good game
STR-1:

KEY-526846: We talk about physical toughness but this is a mental challenge for us now. Focus is more important than ever
STR-1:

KEY-526847: How concerned are [%person#1-you] about suffering a defeat that hurts morale?
STR-1:

KEY-526848: For [%person#1-me] he's the best player on the pitch every time he crosses that line. He'll do what's required
STR-1:

KEY-526849: [%male#2-first] makes it look easy. [%person#1-I]'m pretty confident his ability will shine through
STR-1:

KEY-526850: It's probably not the ideal circumstances for him but we'll do our best to put him in the best possible position to do well
STR-1:

KEY-526851: Why have [%person#1-you] picked [%male#2-surname] when it seems like he might not be fully up to speed?
STR-1:

KEY-526852: Ask For

STR-1:

KEY-526860: [%team#1-short]{s} [%person#1] has received a work permit for [%person#1-his] move to [%team#2-short].
STR-1:

KEY-526861: This will ask the players to engage opponents in wide areas in an attempt to force the ball back into central areas. This might be because the opposition pose a threat in wide areas, or it might be in order to push the ball back inside into central positions to then dispossess the opposition and generate more dangerous counter-attacking opportunities in transition.
STR-1: Sẽ yêu cầu các cầu thủ giao tranh với đối thủ trong phạm vi rộng để cố gắng ngăn bóng di chuyển vào trung lộ. Nó cân bằng nguy hiểm để lại khoảng trống rộng hơn giữa các cầu thủ với cơ hội thu hồi bóng ở xa khung thành.

KEY-526863: Can [%male#2] become regarded as highly as someone like [%male#3] in the annals of [%team#1-short] history?
STR-1:

KEY-526868: I'm happy and I don't really fancy leaving, so I don't think I'll be accepting [%person#2-your] request.
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-526872: I'll be considering all options available to me when my contract expires.
STR-1:

KEY-526873: Look, if you're not going to commit your future to this club, [%person#1-I] won't be able to involve you moving forward.
STR-1:

KEY-526874: [%person#1-I] would really implore you to commit your future to this club as soon as possible. [%person#1-I] want you here.

STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-526881: If [%person#1-I]'m honest [%person#1-I] think you're being led astray by your agent. Surely you want to stay here?
STR-1:

KEY-526882: [%person#1-I] don't think the market is there for you to move on. Staying here is comfortably your best bet.
STR-1:

KEY-526883: The grass isn't always greener, it'd be a risk if you left.
STR-1:

KEY-526884: We're ambitious and we want to achieve great things, but we need you to be a part of that.
STR-1:

KEY-526885: [%male#5] came to [%person#1-me] saying the same thing but ultimately decided to stay. [%person#1-I] think you could learn from him.

STR-1:

KEY-526888: Fine, I guess I'll be staying then.
STR-1:

KEY-526889: I understand where [%person#2-you]'re coming from but I have to put my best interests first.
STR-1:

KEY-526890: We're probably not going to agree on this so I think we should probably end this conversation here.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-526891: I won't allow [%person#2-you] to hold me to ransom. My mind is made up.
STR-1:

KEY-526892: [%person#2-You] can ask all [%person#2-you] want but it won't help. My mind is made up.

STR-1:

KEY-526894: Fair enough, I do like it here too.
STR-1:

KEY-526895: With all due respect, I think [%person#2-you]'re misinformed.
STR-1:

KEY-526896: I don't know who's been briefing [%person#2-you] but I'm not as keen on staying as [%person#2-you] think.
STR-1:

KEY-526897: I'm not interested in staying.
STR-1:

KEY-526898: I do have an interest in staying but I still have to look at all my options, [%person#2-you] must understand that.

STR-1:

KEY-526904: Whether I'm happy here or not isn't important. I need to see what else is out there for me.
STR-1:

KEY-526905: Happy or not, I'll regret it if I don't take this chance to find out what's possible.
STR-1:

KEY-526906: I do like it here but I still have to look at all my options, [%person#2-you] must understand that.
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-526912: This really isn't about whether or not I love the club, it's about the potential that exists elsewhere.

STR-1:

KEY-526918: Fair enough, I do appreciate the relationship I have with the fans.
STR-1:

KEY-526919: I don't know who's been briefing [%person#2-you] but I don't think I'm held in a particularly high regard.
STR-1:

KEY-526920: I'm not well-liked here.
STR-1:

KEY-526921: This really isn't about whether or not I'm well-liked around here, it's about the potential that exists elsewhere.
STR-1:

KEY-526922: How the fans feel about me isn't important at the moment. I need to see what else is out there for me.
STR-1:

KEY-526923: Appreciated or not, I'll regret it if I don't take this chance to find out what's possible.
STR-1:

KEY-526924: I appreciate the sentiment but I still have to look at all my options, [%person#2-you] must understand that.
STR-1:

KEY-526925: Exploring all of my options is more important to me than whether or not I'm liked around here.
STR-1:

KEY-526926: [%person#2-You]'re right, I think we get on well, I'll shelve my plans.
STR-1:

KEY-526927: Fair enough, I do value our relationship.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-526928: With all due respect, I think [%person#2-you] view this relationship differently to me.

STR-1:

KEY-526930: I don't think we get on well at all.[%person#2-hidden]

KEY-526937: I don't know about [%person#2-you] but I've been loyal enough.
STR-1:

KEY-526938: I've been plenty loyal, it's my turn to be selfish now.
STR-1:

KEY-526939: This really isn't about whether or not I'm loyal, it's about the potential that exists elsewhere.
STR-1:

KEY-526940: Whether I'm being loyal or not isn't important. I need to see what else is out there for me.
STR-1:

KEY-526941: Loyal or not, I'll regret it if I don't take this chance to find out what's possible.
STR-1:

KEY-526942: [%person#2-You]'re right, I need to do right by me, not my agent.
STR-1:

KEY-526943: Fair enough, agents are always going to be like that.
STR-1:

KEY-526944: With all due respect, my agent knows best.
STR-1:

KEY-526945: I don't agree with that, my agent and I have a good relationship, and this is my choice.
STR-1:

KEY-526946: My agent has nothing to do with this.
STR-1:

KEY-526947: My agent might be leaning on me but I recognise that I still have to look at all my options, [%person#2-you] must understand that.
STR-1:

KEY-526948: Exploring all of my options is important whether it's my decision or my agent's.
STR-1:

KEY-526949: Maybe [%person#2-you]'re right, if there's no interest then there's no point in exploring.
STR-1:

KEY-526950: Fair enough, if this is where I'm wanted most then I should recognise that.
STR-1:

KEY-526951: I don't know who's been briefing [%person#2-you] but there is plenty of interest in my services.
STR-1:

KEY-526952: I have clubs queuing up for me.
STR-1:

KEY-526953: This really isn't about whether or not there's a market for me, it's about finding it out for myself.
STR-1:

KEY-526954: I need to see what else is out there for myself, not take [%person#2-your] word for it.
STR-1:

KEY-526955: I'll regret it if I don't take this chance to find out what's possible.
STR-1:

KEY-526956: I still have to look at all my options, [%person#2-you] must understand that.
STR-1:

KEY-526957: Exploring all of my options is necessary, even if I find out for myself that there's a lack of interest.
STR-1:

KEY-526958: Whatever merit [%person#2-your] argument has, I'm still more taken by the idea of seeing what else is out there for myself than taking anyone's word for it.
STR-1:

KEY-526959: [%person#2-You]'re right, that would be a risk. Forget I said anything.
STR-1: Ông nói đúng, đó sẽ là một sự rủi ro. Bỏ qua điều tôi nói đi nhé.

KEY-526960: Fair enough, that would be risky.
STR-1:

KEY-526961: With all due respect, I think [%person#2-you]'re overstating that risk.
STR-1:

KEY-526962: I don't know who's been briefing [%person#2-you] but I certainly don't think it's a risk.
STR-1:

KEY-526963: I don't think it's risky.
STR-1:

KEY-526964: It might be a risk but it's one I have to take, [%person#2-you] must understand that.
STR-1:

KEY-526965: Exploring all of my options is worth the risk.
STR-1:

KEY-526966: [%person#2-You]'re right, this is an ambitious club and maybe I should stay put.
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-526968: With all due respect, I think [%person#2-you]'re overstating how ambitious the club is.
STR-1:

KEY-526969: I don't think the club are being as ambitious as [%person#2-you] do.
STR-1:

KEY-526970: I don't see or feel that ambition.
STR-1:

KEY-526971: I recognise the ambition but I still have to look at all my options, [%person#2-you] must understand that.
STR-1:

KEY-526972: Exploring all of my options is more important to me than blindly accepting that this club is the most ambitious option for me.
STR-1:

KEY-526973: [%person#2-You]'re right, if he was happy to reconsider, maybe I should be.
STR-1:

KEY-526974: Fair enough, when [%person#2-you] put it like that.
STR-1:

KEY-526975: With all due respect, I need to look out for myself first and foremost.
STR-1:

KEY-526976: I don't know why [%person#2-you]'re bringing him into it, this is my career.
STR-1:

KEY-526977: Can we talk about my situation please?[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-526978: I respect [%male#5-first] but I still have to look at all my options, [%person#2-you] must understand that.
STR-1:

KEY-526979: Exploring all of my options is more important to me than doing as [%male#5-first] did.
STR-1:

KEY-526980: Okay, that's fair enough. [%person#1-I] appreciate your side of the situation as well.
STR-1:

KEY-526981: Alright, [%person#1-I]'m sorry, feel free to do as you see fit.
STR-1:

KEY-526982: If you're intent on taking this course of action then [%person#1-I]'ll have to give serious thought to marginalising you from the team.
STR-1:

KEY-526983: [%person#1-I] stand by [%person#1-my] reasoning and implore you to reconsider.
STR-1:

KEY-526984: [%person#1-I] really want you to reconsider and sincerely hope you do.

KEY-526987: Good. Hopefully I can get on with my football now.
STR-1:

KEY-526988: I have to say I'm disappointed with how [%person#2-you] responded to me.
STR-1:

KEY-526989: The way [%person#2-you] responded to me here was a little upsetting, I won't lie.
STR-1:

KEY-526990: I'm not too happy that [%person#2-you]'ve tried to change my mind.
STR-1:

KEY-526991: Thanks, [%person#2-you]'ll know about my plans as soon as I do.

STR-1:

KEY-526996: [%person#2-You]'ve made a mistake here; I'm not happy at all that [%person#2-you]'ve tried to change my mind and I certainly won't now.

KEY-526997: Okay, I hear [%person#2-you], I'll have a rethink.
STR-1:

KEY-526998: [%person#2-You]'ve made [%person#2-yourself] perfectly clear so I'll take some time to reconsider my position.

STR-1:

KEY-527000: I'm afraid I'm going to have to do things my way, sorry.

KEY-527001: I'm not happy with how this has gone and I'm definitely going to do what I want regardless of what happens.
STR-1:

KEY-527002: I won't be bullied. This isn't over.

KEY-527003: Alright, I can see [%person#2-you]'re really invested in this, I'll reconsider.
STR-1:

KEY-527004: Okay, [%person#2-you]'ve made [%person#2-yourself] clear, I'll take some time to rethink my position.
STR-1:

KEY-527005: Fine, we'll do things [%person#2-your] way.
STR-1:

KEY-527006: I stand by my reasoning.
STR-1:

KEY-527007: My mind is made up on this.
STR-1:

KEY-527008: [%person#1-I]'m disappointed with your recent conduct; it doesn't show the best of this club, and it needs to improve as soon as possible please.
STR-1:

KEY-527009: I know that performance wasn't what was expected of me and I'll do everything I can to make up for it.
STR-1:

KEY-527010: Fair enough, I'll do better next time.
STR-1: Thế đủ rồi, tôi sẽ làm tốt hơn vào lần sau.

KEY-527011: I know I need to improve and I'll do everything I can to meet the required standards.
STR-1:

KEY-527012: That's a fair assessment; I'll work hard to make improvements to my game.
STR-1:

KEY-527013: [%person#1-I] don't think you've played as well as you can in recent matches; keep working hard to improve.
STR-1:

KEY-527014: [%person#1-I] need you to play better if you want to stay in the first team. [%person#1-I] want to be clear with you about this.
STR-1:

KEY-527015: [%person#1-I] believe in your ability to help this team and [%person#1-I]'m not worried by your goalscoring form. It'll all come back to you soon enough, keep the faith.
STR-1:

KEY-527016: [%person#1-I] don't want you to worry about not scoring in a while; it happens, and the goals will come to you eventually.
STR-1:

KEY-527017: I appreciate the support and I'll keep working hard.
STR-1: Tôi đánh giá cao sự hỗ trợ và tôi sẽ tiếp tục làm việc chăm chỉ.

KEY-527018: [%person#1-I] don't think you've been training very well recently.
STR-1:

KEY-527019: [%person#1-I]'m rather disappointed that you haven't developed as well as expected in recent months.
STR-1:

KEY-527020: [%person#1-I] have to say [%person#1-I]'m disappointed with your lack of development in your new position over the last few months.
STR-1:

KEY-527021: [%person#1-I] have to say [%person#1-I]'m disappointed with your lack of development in your new role over the last few months.
STR-1:

KEY-527022: Alright, [%person#1-I]'ll leave it there.
STR-1:

KEY-527023: [%person#1-I] really think your standards aren't high enough.
STR-1:

KEY-527024: [%person#1-I]'m happy that we've been able to talk about this.
STR-1:

KEY-527025: I won't be forced out, so I guess I have no choice.
STR-1: Không ép buộc được tôi đâu, vì vậy tôi nghĩ tôi không còn lựa chọn nào khác.

KEY-527026: It's clear that we're not going to agree on this, so let's leave it here.
STR-1:

KEY-527027: [%person#1-I]'m going to have to seriously consider putting you on the transfer list if you remain ignorant to your lack of development.
STR-1:

KEY-527028: [%person#1-I]'m going to have to seriously consider putting you on the loan list if you remain ignorant to your lack of development.
STR-1:

KEY-527029: You should give strong consideration to becoming {an}[%job#5] when you've finally called it a day.
STR-1:

KEY-527030: If you want to remain in the game post-retirement [%person#1-I] think you'd do well as {an}[%job#5].
STR-1:

KEY-527031: I'm keen to stay in the game when I'm done playing and that sounds like a really good idea.
STR-1:

KEY-527032: Sure, I'd be interested.
STR-1: Chắc chắn rồi, tôi quan tâm đến điều đó.

KEY-527033: With all due respect, I can't see that role suiting me.
STR-1: Với tất cả sự tôn trọng, tôi không thể thấy vai trò đó phù hợp với tôi.

KEY-527034: Don't be silly, I'd never be good at that job.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-527035: Great! We can start on that as soon as you're ready.
STR-1:

KEY-527036: We can get you started on that right away if you'd like?
STR-1:

KEY-527037: This isn't the right time for you to start; [%person#1-I]'ll come to you when it is.
STR-1:

KEY-527038: There's no need to get started right away; [%person#1-I]'ll let you know when it's time.
STR-1:

KEY-527039: Fair enough, [%person#1-I] thought it'd suit you, but perhaps not.
STR-1:

KEY-527040: Alright, if you think that job wouldn't suit you, [%person#1-I] won't argue with that.
STR-1:

KEY-527041: Okay, with that being said, would you be interested in being {an}[%job#6]? We'd be prepared to help you develop.
STR-1:

KEY-527042: Right, in that case, do you have an interest in possibly becoming {an}[%job#6]? The club will support you with as much development as you need.
STR-1:

KEY-527043: I'm ready to get started now if [%person#2-you] are?
STR-1: Tôi đã sẵn sàng bắt đầu nếu ông muốn?

KEY-527044: I'm alright to get started now if [%person#2-you] want?
STR-1: Tôi có thể bắt đầu ngay bây giờ nếu ông muốn?

KEY-527045: I really appreciate being given this opportunity, thank you.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-527046: I think this'll be really good for me, thanks.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-527047: [%person#1-I] think you could do with a break so [%person#1-I]'m resting you for the next match.
STR-1:

KEY-527048: [%person#1-I] think you could do with a break so [%person#1-I]'m resting you for a fortnight or so.
STR-1:

KEY-527049: That sounds good to me, thanks.
STR-1: Nghe được đấy, cảm ơn ông.

KEY-527050: Alright, I appreciate it.
STR-1: Được đấy, tôi rất trân trọng điều đó.

KEY-527051: How about a fortnight's break instead?
STR-1: Thế được nghỉ hai tuần thì bạn nghĩ sao?

KEY-527052: Let's make sure you at least don't play ninety minutes in the next match then; we need to protect you.
STR-1:

KEY-527053: Try not to worry too much about being injured; [%person#1-I] get that it's frustrating, but focus on your recovery now.
STR-1:

KEY-527054: [%person#1-I] don't want you to worry about playing time when you're back from injury. [%person#1-You]'re still very much in [%person#1-my] plans.
STR-1:

KEY-527055: If it's all the same, I'd just rather get on with my recovery, thanks.
STR-1:

KEY-527056: I don't want to be rude but I'd appreciate being left to focus on things myself for a while, thanks.
STR-1:

KEY-527057: [%person#1-I] just wanted to make sure you know your absence is going to be felt.
STR-1:

KEY-527058: I'd just like to get some time to myself and focus on recovering, thanks.
STR-1:

KEY-527059: Well done on making your [%nation#1] debut!
STR-1:

KEY-527060: It's an honour and I hope I get many more chances to represent my country.
STR-1:

KEY-527061: Thanks, I appreciate the opportunity.
STR-1:

KEY-527062: I've waited a long time for this moment and I'm determined to make sure it's not my only cap.
STR-1:

KEY-527063: Thanks. I'm even hungrier to take the next step now.
STR-1:

KEY-527064: You did well and should be very proud of yourself.
STR-1:

KEY-527065: Thanks for taking the time to talk to me, I appreciate it.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-527066: Alright, thanks for that.
STR-1: Được, cảm ơn vì điều đó.

KEY-527067: Thanks, I can't wait for another opportunity!
STR-1:

KEY-527068: Hopefully I won't go down as a one-cap wonder. I want more now.
STR-1:

KEY-527069: Congratulations on scoring your first goal for [%nation#2]! [%person#1-I]'m so proud of you.
STR-1:

KEY-527070: I'm happy to have scored and I appreciate what [%person#2-you]'ve done for me.
STR-1:

KEY-527071: Thanks, I appreciate the role [%person#2-you]'ve played too.
STR-1:

KEY-527072: I'm really happy to have scored but I'm hungry for even more now.
STR-1:

KEY-527073: This is just the start. I'm not satisfied with just one international goal.
STR-1:

KEY-527074: It took me long enough! I appreciate it though and I hope the next one comes along much sooner.
STR-1:

KEY-527075: I'm glad to have finally done it! Hopefully the next one doesn't require such a wait.
STR-1:

KEY-527076: It's nice to score but it's much nicer to help the team win.
STR-1:

KEY-527077: The result is all that matters, I don't care much for individual achievements.
STR-1:

KEY-527078: That's a great attitude, make sure you keep that mindset.
STR-1:

KEY-527079: You've got the best part of your international career ahead of you.
STR-1:

KEY-527080: If you keep scoring goals for your country you'll go down as a legend, there's no doubt about it.

KEY-527081: Thanks, I really appreciate [%person#2-you] taking the time to talk to me.
STR-1:

KEY-527082: Alright, I appreciate it.

KEY-527083: Thanks, I really appreciate [%person#2-your] time and continued support.
STR-1:

KEY-527084: Thanks, I really can't wait for the next match!
STR-1:

KEY-527085: Right, onto the next one then.
STR-1:

KEY-527086: Thanks, and I hope [%person#2-you] pick me again!
STR-1:

KEY-527087: Hopefully I get another chance to impress.
STR-1:

KEY-527088: [%person#1-I]'d be happy to welcome you back here at any time; you've been a wonderful servant to this club. Good luck!
STR-1:

KEY-527089: Good luck in your next step; [%person#1-I]'d rather it didn't have to come to this, but the club's financial situation demands it.
STR-1:

KEY-527090: [%person#1-I] wanted to wish you the best of luck in your next step; we'd have loved to keep you here but we understand that this opportunity is just too good to turn down.
STR-1:

KEY-527091: That's very nice of [%person#1-you]; I have very fond memories of my time here and I'd love to return in the future
STR-1:

KEY-527092: Thanks, I appreciate that.
STR-1: Cảm ơn ông, tôi đánh giá cao điều đó.

KEY-527093: Thanks. Let's see what happens down the road!
STR-1:

KEY-527094: I more than understand and, who knows, maybe there's another chapter for me here that's yet to be written.
STR-1:

KEY-527095: Alright, I understand, and maybe one day I'll be back.
STR-1:

KEY-527096: [%person#1-I]'m sending you out on loan as it's the best thing for your development right now. Go out there and impress and we'll see where you are when you return.
STR-1:

KEY-527097: [%person#1-I]'d encourage you to make the most of this loan move; if you impress, you'll have all sorts of options at the end of it.
STR-1:

KEY-527098: Look, [%person#1-I] don't currently have any plans for you, so go and get some regular playing time on loan, and then we'll see what the situation looks like at the end of that.
STR-1:

KEY-527099: You're going out on loan because [%person#1-I] think it's the best way for you to get the playing time you need.
STR-1:

KEY-527100: I think that makes sense and I recognise I have a chance to change the direction of my career. I'm looking forward to it.
STR-1:

KEY-527101: Alright then, let's see what happens.
STR-1: Được thưa ông, để xem điều gì sẽ xảy ra.

KEY-527102: I really did enjoy my time here but my future lies elsewhere. Thank [%person#2-you] for making it possible.
STR-1:

KEY-527103: Thanks, this is my time to shine.
STR-1: Cảm ơn ông, đây là thời gian để tôi tỏa sáng.

KEY-527104: I understand how hard it is to find playing time for everyone, and I'm looking forward to a fresh start somewhere else. Thanks!
STR-1:

KEY-527105: Alright then, it's time for me to go and do my thing, thanks.
STR-1:

KEY-527106: Congratulations on winning the [%award#3]!
STR-1:

KEY-527107: Thanks, I'm really happy, and it shows that hard work pays off.
STR-1:

KEY-527108: Thanks, I appreciate it.
STR-1:

KEY-527109: Congratulations on winning the [%award#3]! It's very richly deserved.
STR-1:

KEY-527110: Thanks, I'm really happy!
STR-1:

KEY-527111: We've made it clear to other clubs that you're available for transfer, but we're yet to hear of any interest, so [%person#1-I]'d appreciate it if you'd be more open to the idea of leaving so that we can improve the chances of striking a deal.
STR-1: Chúng ta đã nói rõ với các CLB khác rằng bạn có thể chuyển nhượng, nhưng chúng tôi vẫn chưa nhận được bất kỳ sự quan tâm nào, vì vậy tôi đánh giá cao nếu bạn cởi mở hơn với ý nghĩ ra đi để chúng ta có thể cải thiện cơ hội đạt được một thỏa thuận.

KEY-527112: [%person#1-I]'d suggest that this is the best chance you'll have to control where your career takes you next.
STR-1: Tôi khuyên đây là cơ hội tốt nhất để bạn kiểm soát được bến đỗ tiếp theo trong sự nghiệp của mình.

KEY-527113: [%person#1-I] can't give you any assurances of a future at the club so [%person#1-I] think you should take control of your own destiny.
STR-1: Tôi không thể đảm bảo cho bạn tương lai ở CLB, nên tôi nghĩ là bạn nên tự kiểm soát vận mệnh của chính mình.

KEY-527114: [%person#1-I]'m going to struggle to register you for competitions if you stay so [%person#1-I]'d suggest exploring your options.
STR-1: Tôi sẽ gặp khó khăn trong việc đăng ký bạn tham gia các giải đấu nếu bạn ở lại, tôi khuyên bạn nên tham khảo các lựa chọn của mình xem thế nào.

KEY-527115: [%person#1-I]'ll be completely clear; you aren't in [%person#1-my] plans and so [%person#1-I] think it's in your best interests to find yourself a new club as soon as possible.
STR-1: Tôi rất rõ ràng; bạn không có trong các kế hoạch của tôi và vì vậy tôi nghĩ là bạn nên tìm cho mình một CLB mới càng sớm càng tốt.

KEY-527116: [%person#1-I] think this is a great time for you to look elsewhere and find a place to make a fresh start.
STR-1: Tôi thấy đây là thời điểm tuyệt vời để bạn tìm kiếm cơ hội ở nơi khác, và tìm một nơi để bắt đầu làm lại.

KEY-527117: The truth is that we can't afford your salary, so [%person#1-I]'m asking you to help us out.
STR-1: Sự thật là chúng tôi không đủ khả năng trả lương cho bạn, vì vậy tôi đang thỉnh cầu bạn giúp chúng tôi.

KEY-527118: [%person#1-I] really have to insist at this stage.
STR-1: Tôi thực sự phải nhấn mạnh trong giai đoạn này.

KEY-527119: [%person#1-I]'m not afraid to marginalise you until we've come to an agreement if that's what it takes.
STR-1: Tôi không ngại cho bạn ra rìa cho đến khi chúng ta đi đến thỏa thuận nếu đó là điều cần thiết.

KEY-527120: [%person#1-I]'m prepared to leave you out of our registered squads if [%person#1-I] have to.
STR-1: Tôi đã chuẩn bị để loại bạn ra khỏi đội hình đã đăng ký nếu tôi buộc phải làm vậy.

KEY-527121: [%person#1-I]'m getting increasingly desperate now; [%person#1-I] need your help.
STR-1: Tôi hiện ngày càng tuyệt vọng; tôi cần bạn giúp tôi.

KEY-527122: [%person#1-I]'m sure you'd like to move to [%team#3-short] but it's really worth considering [%team#4-short] instead. [%person#1-I] think it'd be the best move you could make at this stage of your career.
STR-1: Tôi đảm bảo rằng bạn muốn chuyển tới [%team#3-short] nhưng thực sự đáng cân nhắc đến [%team#4-short] thay cho đội bạn thích hơn.Tôi nghĩ nó sẽ là lựa chọn tốt nhất mà bạn có thể làm trong giai đoạn này của sự nghiệp

KEY-527123: I appreciate the advice but I'm not interested in going there.
STR-1:

KEY-527124: I'm not joining [%team#4-short], simple as that.
STR-1:

KEY-527125: [%person#1-I] know it's up to you but [%person#1-I] really would urge you to reconsider.
STR-1: [%person#1-I] biết điều đó tùy thuộc vào amh nhưng [%person#1-I] thực sự mong anh xem xét lại.

KEY-527126: Fair enough, [%person#1-I] had to check, but it's your decision.
STR-1: Được rồi, tôi phải xem lại, nhưng đó là quyết định của bạn

KEY-527127: Sorry, I have to do what I think is right for me.
STR-1: Xin lỗi, tôi phải làm điều tốt cho bản thân tôi.

KEY-527128: I won't allow [%person#2-you] to influence my decisions. This conversation is over.
STR-1: Tôi không để cho ông ảnh hưởng đến quyết định của tôi đâu. Chúng ta nói chuyện xong rồi.

KEY-527129: [%person#1-I] wanted to say thank you for the part you play in promoting the team and showing the very best of what we do. You're a credit to the club.
STR-1:

KEY-527130: [%person#1-I]'m really pleased with how you played last match and that you scored; keep up the good work!

STR-1:

KEY-527136: Thanks! That sort of praise really helps me a lot.
STR-1: Cảm ơn ông, những lời khen đó thật sự giúp tôi rất nhiều.

KEY-527137: Thanks, I'll keep doing what I'm doing.
STR-1: Cảm ơn, tôi sẽ tiếp tục những gì tôi đang làm.

KEY-527138: It's nice to hear [%person#2-you] say that, thanks very much.
STR-1:

KEY-527139: I have to admit that I'm a little surprised by [%person#2-your] praise as I think I've played better than that.
STR-1:

KEY-527140: Really? I don't think I played that well.
STR-1: Có thật không? Tôi không nghĩ rằng mình đã chơi tốt như vậy.

KEY-527141: With all due respect, I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm better left to focus on my game than to be the subject of praise.
STR-1:

KEY-527142: You were at your creative best in our last match, keep up the good work!
STR-1:

KEY-527143: [%person#1-I] really enjoyed your more direct approach in our last match, that's what we're looking for!
STR-1:

KEY-527144: You led the line beautifully last time out; keep up the good work!
STR-1:

KEY-527145: [%person#1-I] think you're doing really well on this loan spell, keep up the good work!

STR-1: Cậu đang học vai trò mới tốt đấy, gắng duy trì nhé!

KEY-527154: Would you be willing to talk to [%male#3] about possibly joining us? You two get along very well at international level and it might help our chances of signing him.
STR-1:

KEY-527155: I'd be happy to; leave it with me.
STR-1: Không vấn đề gì; Để đó cho tôi.

KEY-527156: Alright, I can do that if [%person#2-you] want.
STR-1:

KEY-527157: Sure, I'll have a word.

STR-1:

KEY-527308: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] has a decision to make

KEY-527309: [%person#1-I] know what you know. He has the right to explore his options and it looks like he's going to do that
STR-1:

KEY-527310: He has a decision to make but, remember, one of those decisions could be that he wants to continue playing here
STR-1:

KEY-527311: It's the first [%person#1-I]'ve heard of it but [%person#1-I] would expect him to stay here when all's said and done

KEY-527312: What happens now after [%male#2] was put on the transfer list at his own request?
STR-1:

KEY-527313: Can [%person#1-you] tell us what happens now following the news that [%male#2] has been transfer-listed at his own request?

KEY-527319: [%person#1-I] don't think much has changed really; he's expressed a desire to leave but we're going to do all we can to change his mind
STR-1:

KEY-527320: He's obviously come to us with some concerns and has asked to leave but we're confident we can give him every reason to want to stay
STR-1:

KEY-527321: [%person#1-I]'m staying upbeat; things change very quickly in football and we're certainly not giving up the fight to keep him
STR-1:

KEY-527322: Let's be positive and upbeat; he remains {an}[%team#1-short] player for now and, while that's the case, we can work hard to turn the situation around
STR-1:

KEY-527323: It's up to him now. He has to go away and think about what he really wants and whether it's the best decision for his career
STR-1:

KEY-527324: [%person#1-I]'ve put the ball in his court. He now has to make a big decision about what comes next for him and his career
STR-1:

KEY-527325: Things like this always happen in football. If he wants to move on then we'll see if we can strike a good deal for all parties
STR-1:

KEY-527326: [%person#1-I] don't want anyone at this club unless they're 100% committed. If he really wants to leave, we won't fight it
STR-1:

KEY-527327: [%male#2]{s} disgruntlement with how things have been going on the pitch for [%team#1-short] has led to him requesting a transfer. What happens now?
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-527330: [%person#1-I] believe we can keep him. He's rightly disappointed with our fortunes but we know we can improve and we can convince him of that
STR-1:

KEY-527331: Nobody here is happy with how we've been playing but we need to stick together. [%person#1-I] want him to help us realise our potential
STR-1:

KEY-527332: [%person#1-I] have to be positive; he's still {an}[%team#1-short] player and hopefully we can convince him to help improve our fortunes
STR-1:

KEY-527333: Let's be positive; he's got the right mentality in terms of wanting to be better. It's our job to make sure he wants to stay and do that here
STR-1:

KEY-527334: [%person#1-I]'m not happy with how we've been doing but [%person#1-I]'m not clamouring for him to leave. He has to decide what he wants, it's up to him
STR-1:

KEY-527335: He has a decision to make as to where his loyalties lie. We all want to do better for [%team#1-short] but we need everyone fully committed to do that
STR-1:

KEY-527336: [%male#2] is reportedly unhappy with how his career is developing at [%team#1-short] and has now requested to leave. What happens next?

STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-527339: [%person#1-I] can't fault his ambition, it's admirable, but [%person#1-I] would urge him to reconsider his options and give everything to realise his potential with us
STR-1:

KEY-527340: [%person#1-I]'m choosing to be positive. He wants to achieve great things and it's [%person#1-my] job to convince him that he can do that here
STR-1:

KEY-527341: He's still {an}[%team#1-short] player and that gives us the opportunity, each and every day, to give him reasons to stay
STR-1:

KEY-527342: It's up to him now. It's easy to think the grass is greener elsewhere but that isn't always the case
STR-1:

KEY-527343: [%person#1-I]'d ask him to decide what he really wants. Is moving at this stage of his career the best decision he could make?

KEY-527347: [%person#1-I] want to keep our best players here and [%person#1-I] think we can do that. He might have misunderstood exactly what's going on right now
STR-1:

KEY-527348: [%person#1-I]'m going to continue to talk to him and do [%person#1-my] best to allay his fears. We have to be positive and think he'll change his mind
STR-1:

KEY-527349: He's here for the time being and that gives us a chance to try to change his mind. There's a lot going on and sometimes it's helpful to discuss things patiently and with understanding
STR-1:

KEY-527350: The decision he has to make is whether he's going to focus on his game, or let himself be distracted by things out of his control. If it's the latter, he'll experience the same thing wherever he goes
STR-1:

KEY-527351: [%person#1-I] believe he has to choose whether or not he's going to be distracted by stuff he can't control. That's really what this boils down to

STR-1:

KEY-527353: Can [%person#1-you] tell us what happens now following the news that [%male#2] has asked to leave because of how he feels he's been treated recently?
STR-1:

KEY-527354: [%person#1-I] still don't know why he feels mistreated but, because it seems like it's something about nothing, [%person#1-I] reckon we can sort this out and move on
STR-1:

KEY-527355: If he feels aggrieved then it's up to us to sort it out. It sounds like something we can deal with quickly and then forget about, because we want him to stay
STR-1:

KEY-527356: [%person#1-I] don't think we should resign ourselves to thinking he's gone; this is a fluid situation that we're working through as best we can
STR-1:

KEY-527357: He hasn't left yet and might well never leave. We're still talking and, hopefully, we can work out our differences
STR-1:

KEY-527358: It's his choice now. He's asked to leave but he can just as easily retract that request if he decides he's acted rashly
STR-1:

KEY-527359: [%person#1-I]'m putting the ball in his court. If he wants to change his mind and stay, it's up to him. We'll be waiting
STR-1:

KEY-527360: Can [%person#1-you] lead [%team#1-short] towards the expectations they harboured at the start of the season?
STR-1:

KEY-527361: How excited are [%person#1-you] to be [%team#1-short]{s} new manager?
STR-1:

KEY-527362: Just how hard is it to build an expansion team from scratch?
STR-1:

KEY-527363: What are the challenges involved in building an expansion team squad from the ground up?
STR-1:

KEY-527364: [%person#1-surname]: Expansion process 'exciting'
STR-1:

KEY-527365: [%person#1-surname]: Constructing new team is fun
STR-1:

KEY-527366: [%person#1-surname] daunted by scale of job at [%team#1-short]
STR-1:

KEY-527367: [%person#1-surname]: There's just so much to do
STR-1:

KEY-527368: [%person#1-I]'ll have a better answer to that when [%person#1-I] emerge on the other side of this. It's all so new at the moment
STR-1:

KEY-527369: [%person#1-I] don't know about how hard it is, but it's definitely exciting. We have a clean slate to do exactly as we please
STR-1:

KEY-527370: There is a lot to do but [%person#1-I] actually find it more exciting than anything else. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
STR-1:

KEY-527371: [%person#1-I] think we can have a lot of fun here. We need to approach this with a positive attitude, not one that cowers away from the decisions we need to make
STR-1:

KEY-527372: [%person#1-I] have a blank canvas and all the trust in the world to go about constructing a new team. How can that not be fun?
STR-1:

KEY-527373: It's definitely daunting; there's no foundation to lean on or people who've been here for a long time to help out. It's all on us
STR-1:

KEY-527374: [%person#1-I]'ll readily admit it's a pretty daunting process; we're responsible for every decision from day one and there's no safety net
STR-1:

KEY-527375: There's just so much to do! [%person#1-I]'m delighted to be here but this is going to be a long and hard job for everyone
STR-1:

KEY-527376: [%person#1-I] don't think anyone truly realises how much work there is to do until they're in a job like this. There's just so much!
STR-1:

KEY-527377: What will be [%person#1-your] priority in the expansion draft?
STR-1:

KEY-527378: How will [%person#1-you] approach the expansion draft?
STR-1:

KEY-527379: [%person#1-surname] wants the best players at [%team#1-short]
STR-1:

KEY-527380: [%person#1-surname] seeking match winners in Expansion Draft
STR-1:

KEY-527381: [%person#1-surname] looking for bargains in Expansion Draft
STR-1:

KEY-527382: [%person#1-surname] keen to strike balance in new squad
STR-1:

KEY-527383: We're still discussing and finalising our plans at this stage
STR-1:

KEY-527384: [%person#1-I] want the best players available to us. That's what we're prioritising
STR-1:

KEY-527385: We need good players first and foremost, so we'll be analysing who might be available, and go from there
STR-1:

KEY-527386: [%person#1-I] think any manager wants players who can win matches. That'll be among our biggest needs
STR-1:

KEY-527387: [%person#1-I] don't care where they play, but [%person#1-I] want match winners. We'll need to hit the ground running and need players who can make an impact
STR-1:

KEY-527388: There are a lot of pieces to the puzzle and one of the best way to find an advantage is to capture a bargain or two. We're digging deep into our research to find those players
STR-1:

KEY-527389: If we can snag a bargain or two along the way [%person#1-I]'ll be very happy as it'll give us a lot more flexibility
STR-1:

KEY-527390: Everything is about having the right balance. We have to know who's available and how each selection impacts the next one
STR-1:

KEY-527391: We need balance. We have to make sensible decisions and ensure that we're competitive in every area of the pitch
STR-1:

KEY-527392: What do [%person#1-you] think is realistically achievable in [%person#1-your] first season?
STR-1:

KEY-527393: What can this club achieve in year one?
STR-1:

KEY-527394: [%person#1-surname]: We want to win
STR-1:

KEY-527395: [%person#1-surname] aiming for successful start at [%team#1-short]
STR-1:

KEY-527396: [%person#1-surname] stresses need for patience
STR-1:

KEY-527397: [%person#1-surname] under no illusions about scale of task at [%team#1-short]
STR-1:

KEY-527398: We'll see how it goes; there's no point in making predictions at this stage
STR-1:

KEY-527399: [%person#1-I]'m a winner and [%person#1-I] want to win here. There's no project; we're in it to be as good as we can from day one
STR-1:

KEY-527400: If we're not aiming as high as we can from the very start then we're doing ourselves a disservice
STR-1:

KEY-527401: [%person#1-I] want us to be competitive and successful as early as possible because that momentum could carry us a lot further
STR-1:

KEY-527402: We're ambitious and keen to succeed as early as possible. Who knows where a good start could take us?
STR-1:

KEY-527403: We do need to be patient; this is a big job and the fruits of our labours won't necessarily be obvious this season
STR-1:

KEY-527404: [%person#1-I] want the fans - and the media - to be patient with us. This is a long-term project and we're just laying the foundations right now
STR-1:

KEY-527405: This is a huge job and the demands of what we're doing mean that it's going to take a long time until we're at a level to compete
STR-1:

KEY-527406: We won't be as competitive as we'd like in year one, that's just not possible given the circumstances. [%person#1-I] have to be realistic about the scale of the task at hand
STR-1:

KEY-527407: Do [%person#1-you] have any particular targets for the Designated Player slots?
STR-1:

KEY-527408: Have [%person#1-you] identified any potential Designated Players yet?
STR-1:

KEY-527409: [%person#1-surname] eyeing up Designated Players
STR-1:

KEY-527410: [%person#1-surname] exploring Designated Player options
STR-1:

KEY-527411: [%team#1-short] squad still at planning stage, says [%person#1-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-527412: [%person#1-surname]: No decisions have been made yet
STR-1:

KEY-527413: [%person#1-I]'ve only just arrived here!
STR-1:

KEY-527414: [%person#1-I] have some players in mind and, hopefully, we can strike a deal
STR-1:

KEY-527415: We know who we'd like to bring in; now it's about making that happen
STR-1:

KEY-527416: [%person#1-I] have a pretty refined shortlist already and we're working to make things happen
STR-1:

KEY-527417: We're exploring our options but a few players have stood out to us already
STR-1:

KEY-527418: We're still at the planning stage and haven't settled on our strongest preferences yet
STR-1:

KEY-527419: We're not at that stage yet; we're still deep in planning
STR-1:

KEY-527420: No decisions have been made on any players yet
STR-1:

KEY-527421: We haven't made any decisions on that yet
STR-1:

KEY-527422: What sort of squad do [%person#1-you] hope to assemble here?
STR-1:

KEY-527423: What sort of squad would [%person#1-you] like to build at [%team#1-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-527424: [%person#1-surname]: We'll build formidable squad
STR-1:

KEY-527425: [%person#1-surname] wants to build [%team#1-short] in [%person#1-his] image
STR-1:

KEY-527426: [%person#1-surname]: We'll work within our means
STR-1:

KEY-527427: [%person#1-surname] expresses uncertainty about [%team#1-short] squad
STR-1:

KEY-527428: [%person#1-I] have some ideas but let's see how things unfold, shall we?
STR-1:

KEY-527429: [%person#1-I] want a formidable squad that can win in any environment and under any circumstances
STR-1:

KEY-527430: We want to be formidable, hard to play against, and always in with a chance of winning. It's about having players with the right mentality
STR-1:

KEY-527431: [%person#1-I] want to build this team in [%person#1-my] image and, most importantly, we want to win
STR-1:

KEY-527432: [%person#1-I] think most managers want to build their teams in their image and [%person#1-I]'m no different
STR-1:

KEY-527433: We'll work within our means - we have to - and we'll assemble the best group of players that we can in those circumstances
STR-1:

KEY-527434: We don't have the greatest resources or the strongest platform, so we'll work within our means, and do as much as we can with what we have
STR-1:

KEY-527435: Expansion teams are traditionally not the strongest. [%person#1-I] don't know what it'll look like but it will take time to get us to where we want to be
STR-1:

KEY-527436: [%person#1-I] don't know what sort of team we'll build. [%person#1-I] know what [%person#1-I] want it to look like but that might be a long time away from happening
STR-1:

KEY-527437: Is [%male#2-surname] the sort of goalkeeper who can be the difference between winning and losing?
STR-1:

KEY-527438: Could [%male#2-surname] prove to be a match-winner for [%team#1-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-527439: One player can sometimes prove the difference between winning and losing in important matches. Do [%person#1-you] see [%male#2-surname] as a goalkeeper in that mould?
STR-1:

KEY-527440: It only takes one moment to win or lose a match. How pivotal do you expect [%male#2-surname] to be in those types of matches in goal for [%team#1-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-527441: That's why we've brought him in; he gives us the confidence that we have a goalkeeper who can win us points on a regular basis
STR-1:

KEY-527442: He's a match-winner, that's why we signed him, and [%person#1-I]'m confident he'll prove it
STR-1:

KEY-527443: [%person#1-I]'m delighted to have him here. The fans will love his confidence, his authority and the saves he makes
STR-1:

KEY-527444: He's a top goalkeeper and they often decide big games. We've got huge hopes for him
STR-1:

KEY-527445: He's got a little bit of everything and [%person#1-I] think he's the type of player that could prove crucial in important moments
STR-1:

KEY-527446: We certainly hope so! That's what we want from all of our players, but it's nice to have a goalkeeper to rely on too
STR-1:

KEY-527447: If he can turn draws into wins then that'll do nicely. A goalkeeper can make such a difference in a way that no other player in the team can
STR-1:

KEY-527448: That's the aim! We certainly hope he'll come up big when it matters most
STR-1:

KEY-527449: [%person#1-I]'m certainly confident he'll deliver in the big fixtures. He's that sort of goalkeeper
STR-1:

KEY-527450: We have no doubt of the quality he possesses and [%person#1-I] hope he produces when we need him to
STR-1:

KEY-527451: Let's wait and see; he'll have a role to play, but it'd be nice if we weren't always relying on our goalkeeper to earn us points
STR-1:

KEY-527452: [%person#1-I] don't want to put that sort of pressure on him straight away. Goalkeepers always need time to settle in
STR-1:

KEY-527453: [%person#1-I]'m not going to burden him by agreeing to statements like that, [%person#1-I]'ve seen goalkeepers ruined. All [%person#1-I]'ll say is we're delighted he's here
STR-1:

KEY-527454: He wouldn't be here if we didn't believe in his quality but [%person#1-I]'m keen to ease the burden on every player, especially goalkeepers
STR-1:

KEY-527455: [%person#1-I]'m not a fan of putting too much pressure on a new goalkeeper to deliver instantly. Let's allow him time to settle before expecting big performances
STR-1:

KEY-527456: He's not going to come in and win us matches right away because we're not that sort of team, but we have high hopes for him
STR-1:

KEY-527457: We're not looking to him to be a regular match-winner, but he's a good signing nonetheless
STR-1:

KEY-527458: [%person#1-I]'m not sure he fits that profile of goalkeeper. He'll be fine as he is
STR-1:

KEY-527459: [%person#1-I]'m not interested in putting labels on him. He's a good goalkeeper and we're happy he's here
STR-1:

KEY-527460: Is [%male#2-surname] the sort of defender who can be a real foundation for this team?
STR-1:

KEY-527461: Could [%male#2-surname] prove to be a foundation upon which to build for [%team#1-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-527462: All successful teams are built on a strong defensive foundation. Do [%person#1-you] see [%male#2-surname] as a defender who can bring that to the club?
STR-1:

KEY-527463: How important do [%person#2-you] expect [%male#2-surname] to be in becoming a foundation at the back for [%team#1-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-527464: That's why we've brought him in; he's the player we can build a team around
STR-1:

KEY-527465: He's a rock of a player and that's why we signed him. [%person#1-I] think this team will eventually gravitate towards him
STR-1:

KEY-527466: [%person#1-I]'m delighted to have him here. He's the type of player a manager dreams of having at the heart of the team
STR-1:

KEY-527467: He's a top defender and a really big piece of the puzzle. [%person#1-I]'m so happy to have him here
STR-1:

KEY-527468: He's got everything [%person#1-I] want in a player to build around
STR-1:

KEY-527469: We certainly hope so! That's what we want from all of our players, but it's clear he has that about him
STR-1:

KEY-527470: Having a player like him to build around can make such a difference
STR-1:

KEY-527471: That's the aim! We certainly hope he'll be at the forefront of everything we do going forward
STR-1:

KEY-527472: [%person#1-I]'m certainly confident he'll deliver in the big fixtures. He's that sort of player and person
STR-1:

KEY-527473: We have no doubt of the quality he possesses and [%person#1-I] hope he produces when we need him to
STR-1:

KEY-527474: Let's wait and see; he'll have a role to play and, if he can become a foundational piece, all the better
STR-1:

KEY-527475: [%person#1-I] don't want to put that sort of pressure on him straight away. Let's see what sort of role he adopts on and off the pitch
STR-1:

KEY-527476: [%person#1-I]'m not going to burden him by agreeing to statements like that, [%person#1-I]'ve seen players ruined. All [%person#1-I]'ll say is we're delighted he's here
STR-1:

KEY-527477: He wouldn't be here if we didn't believe in his quality but [%person#1-I]'m not going to put that weight of expectation on him right away
STR-1:

KEY-527478: [%person#1-I]'m not a fan of putting too much pressure on defenders. Let's allow him time to settle before making such bold claims
STR-1:

KEY-527479: He's not going to come in be that player straight away for obvious reasons, but we have high hopes for him
STR-1:

KEY-527480: We're not looking to him to be any more of a foundation than anyone else here, but he's a good signing nonetheless
STR-1:

KEY-527481: [%person#1-I]'m not sure that's his style. We're happy with him as he is
STR-1:

KEY-527482: [%person#1-I]'m not interested in putting labels on him. He's a good defender and we're happy he's here
STR-1:

KEY-527483: In [%person#1-my] experience it takes being in the right environment for potential to flourish, and [%person#1-I] hope we can give that to him here
STR-1:

KEY-527484: Do [%person#1-you] think [%male#2] will be able to overcome any language barriers as quickly as he needs to?
STR-1:

KEY-527485: Do [%person#1-you] think you now have too many players [%position#2-sentence]?
STR-1:

KEY-527486: Does this deal leave [%person#1-you] with too many options [%position#2-sentence]?
STR-1:

KEY-527487: He was outstanding. When you have a goalkeeper like that, you're always in with a chance, and unfortunately for us that was the case today
STR-1:

KEY-527488: There isn't much more we could've done; he was outstanding
STR-1:

KEY-527489: If it wasn't for him, we'd have scored a lot more
STR-1:

KEY-527490: On another day we'd have scored five or six but, unfortunately, he was really on his game today
STR-1:

KEY-527491: That's one of the best goalkeeping displays [%person#1-I]'ve seen in a very long time
STR-1:

KEY-527492: That sort of thing happens every now and then, especially with goalkeepers. We'll give him the credit he deserves and move on
STR-1:

KEY-527493: We knew he was the sort of goalkeeper who could take a game away from a team single-handedly and so it proved
STR-1:

KEY-527494: There's no doubting his quality and we have to accept that it's tough when a goalkeeper puts in a performance like that
STR-1:

KEY-527495: Any manager in the world would love to have a goalkeeper who can play like that
STR-1:

KEY-527496: He was alright but the quality of our finishing let us down
STR-1:

KEY-527497: He was okay but they played well as a team
STR-1:

KEY-527498: We made things easy for him with our poor quality of finishing, although he does deserve some credit himself, of course
STR-1:

KEY-527499: It was a solid goalkeeping performance. Whether or not he was the best player on the pitch is another thing altogether
STR-1:

KEY-527500: [%person#1-I] think the question should be centred around how we allowed him to make so many saves. We made him look good
STR-1:

KEY-527501: [%male#2] has now made [%number#1] league appearances for [%team#1-short]. What does he mean to this club?
STR-1:

KEY-527502: Is it a reflection of [%person#1-your] dominance that [%team#2-short] didn't have so much as a single shot on target?
STR-1:

KEY-527503: [%person#1-Your] team won today despite some debatable decisions from the match officials. Do [%person#1-you] have anything to say about that?
STR-1:

KEY-527504: Are [%person#1-you] perhaps relieved to have won a match that might have otherwise been marred by a questionable refereeing performance?

STR-1:

KEY-527511: [%person#1-I]'m really only concentrating on what we can control; we won, and [%person#1-I]'m happy
STR-1:

KEY-527512: [%person#1-I]'m definitely relieved. We've all been there when officiating decisions cost you points and [%person#1-I]'m glad that wasn't the case today
STR-1:

KEY-527513: That's football sometimes, but [%person#1-I] am quite relieved to have won
STR-1:

KEY-527514: [%person#1-I] don't want to overlook those decisions just because we won; [%person#1-I]'d have been very disappointed had we not
STR-1:

KEY-527515: [%person#1-I] can't pretend that the standard of officiating was good just because we won. [%person#1-I]'m disappointed, things must improve
STR-1:

KEY-527516: It's not good enough; we won today but we won't be so lucky next time. The officials have to do better
STR-1:

KEY-527517: [%person#1-I] can't really enjoy this win because [%person#1-I] know the officiating was poor. We must all demand more consistency
STR-1:

KEY-527518: How frustrating is it to have lost a match like that considering the questionable decisions made by the officials?
STR-1:

KEY-527519: Is it more frustrating to lose a match where the standard of officiating was perhaps not as high as it should be?
STR-1:

KEY-527520: [%person#1-surname] refuses to condemn officials
STR-1:

KEY-527521: [%person#1-surname] won't blame officials for defeat
STR-1:

KEY-527522: [%person#1-surname] disappointed with officials after defeat
STR-1:

KEY-527523: [%person#1-surname]: Decisions cost [%team#1-short] dearly
STR-1:

KEY-527524: [%person#1-I] don't think it helps us to blame the defeat on anyone else. We brought it on ourselves
STR-1:

KEY-527525: We lost, that's the way it goes sometimes. [%person#1-I]'m not going to put more pressure on officials who have a hard enough job as it is
STR-1:

KEY-527526: There's nobody to blame for this defeat but ourselves. That's all [%person#1-I]'ll say
STR-1:

KEY-527527: [%person#1-I] don't think we can blame the result on the officials, we didn't deserve to win
STR-1:

KEY-527528: We're hardly without blame ourselves but [%person#1-I] do think our job was made a little harder
STR-1:

KEY-527529: [%person#1-I] know we didn't play as well as we can but [%person#1-I] think we do also need to ask questions of the officials
STR-1:

KEY-527530: The poor decisions made by the officials definitely cost us today. [%person#1-I] know that much is true
STR-1:

KEY-527531: We lost because of the poor decisions made by the match officials, simple
STR-1:

KEY-527532: [%person#1-Your] team won today despite some very questionable decisions from the match officials. Do [%person#1-you] have anything to say about that?
STR-1:

KEY-527533: Are [%person#1-you] perhaps relieved to have won a match that might have otherwise been marred by a poor refereeing performance?
STR-1:

KEY-527534: [%person#1-surname] happy to win
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-527539: [%person#1-I] might have had a different answer had we not won, but [%person#1-I]'m really just happy enough to have done so
STR-1:

KEY-527540: [%person#1-I]'m really only concentrating on what we can control. [%person#1-I]'m happy we won
STR-1:

KEY-527541: [%person#1-I]'m relieved as much as anything; [%person#1-I] don't think the officials had a good game but we've won anyway
STR-1:

KEY-527542: You're going to get bad games from the officials now and then so [%person#1-I] am quite relieved to have won
STR-1:

KEY-527543: [%person#1-I] don't want to overlook those poor decisions just because we won; [%person#1-I]'d have been very disappointed had we not
STR-1:

KEY-527544: [%person#1-I] can't pretend that the standard of officiating was acceptable just because we won. It was not of the standard we expect
STR-1:

KEY-527545: It really isn't good enough; we won today but we won't be so lucky next time. How much longer do we have to wait for things to improve?
STR-1:

KEY-527546: [%person#1-I]'m left with a sour taste in [%person#1-my] mouth because the win was influenced by poor officiating. That's unacceptable
STR-1:

KEY-527547: How frustrating is it to have lost a match like that considering the highly questionable decisions made by the officials?
STR-1:

KEY-527548: Is it more frustrating to lose a match where the standard of officiating was widely deemed to have been unacceptable?
STR-1:

KEY-527549: We're hardly without blame ourselves but [%person#1-I] do think the officials had a particularly bad game
STR-1:

KEY-527550: The officials cost us today. This result is on them
STR-1:

KEY-527551: [%person#1-I]'m angry right now. The only reason we lost is because of the decisions made by the officials
STR-1:

KEY-527552: [%person#1-Your] team won today despite what many people have described as a terrible officiating performance. Do [%person#1-you] have anything to say about that?
STR-1:

KEY-527553: [%person#1-I] know there's a lot of talk about how things unfolded but [%person#1-I]'m happy with the win
STR-1:

KEY-527554: [%person#1-I]'m happy we won and [%person#1-I]'ll let everyone else talk about the other stuff
STR-1:

KEY-527555: [%person#1-I]'m really just relieved. It's clear that there's some controversy but we'll move on from that
STR-1:

KEY-527556: We talk about officiating a lot but [%person#1-I] am quite relieved to have won
STR-1:

KEY-527557: [%person#1-I] won't come out here and in good conscience ignore the decisions made by the officials today. We should all be very disappointed
STR-1:

KEY-527558: [%person#1-I] can't pretend that the standard of officiating was anything other than terrible just because we won. That sort of thing cannot happen
STR-1:

KEY-527559: It's unacceptable. We were lucky today but we might not be next time. It's on all of us to demand improvements now
STR-1:

KEY-527560: [%person#1-I] can't enjoy this win because of how it was influenced by unbelievably bad officiating
STR-1:

KEY-527561: How frustrating is it to have lost a match like that considering the controversial way the match was officiated?
STR-1:

KEY-527562: Is it more frustrating to lose a match where the standard of officiating was as bad as that?
STR-1:

KEY-527563: We're hardly without blame ourselves but [%person#1-I] don't think any of us should accept that sort of officiating
STR-1:

KEY-527564: [%person#1-I] know we didn't play as well as we can but [%person#1-I] don't think any of us can ignore the decisions we saw made during the match
STR-1:

KEY-527565: The officials cost us today. [%person#1-I] don't think we've ever seen a game refereed that poorly
STR-1:

KEY-527566: [%person#1-I]'m angry right now. That was as bad as [%person#1-I]'ve ever seen a team of officials in a match of football
STR-1:

KEY-527567: Do [%person#1-you] think [%person#1-your] players thrived on the big stage?
STR-1:

KEY-527568: Did [%person#1-your] players enjoy playing on the bigger stage? Was that key to getting this result?
STR-1:

KEY-527569: [%person#1-surname]: Players loved the big stage
STR-1:

KEY-527570: [%person#1-surname]: [%person#1-My] players belong here
STR-1:

KEY-527571: [%person#1-surname] wants to build on 'potential' at [%team#1-short]
STR-1:

KEY-527572: [%person#1-surname]: Now we have to focus
STR-1:

KEY-527573: It's been a great day but [%person#1-I] won't be getting carried away
STR-1:

KEY-527574: [%person#1-I] knew we'd give a good account of ourselves and so it proved. The players loved it and want even more
STR-1:

KEY-527575: The players loved it and [%person#1-I] think we showed what we're all about
STR-1:

KEY-527576: We belong here. [%person#1-My] players certainly belong here and they've justified that confidence now
STR-1:

KEY-527577: It's clear that these players belong on the big stage and, hopefully, there'll be many more opportunities ahead for them
STR-1:

KEY-527578: They've had a little taste of the bright lights and it's clear they enjoyed it. Now we have to build on that potential
STR-1:

KEY-527579: We've shown our potential and now we have to go away and make good on it so that these occasions happen every week
STR-1:

KEY-527580: It's been a great experience for them but we have to focus to the future
STR-1:

KEY-527581: It's been great, but we can't dwell on it, and we have to shift our focus back to what comes next
STR-1:

KEY-527582: Do [%person#1-you] think [%person#1-your] players wilted under the spotlight and pressure of playing in front of such a big crowd?
STR-1:

KEY-527583: Did the size of the occasion and the [%stadium#2] crowd prove too much for [%person#1-your] players?
STR-1:

KEY-527584: [%person#1-surname] proud of [%team#1-short] players
STR-1:

KEY-527585: [%person#1-surname]: We showed spirit
STR-1:

KEY-527586: [%person#1-surname]: Stage was too big for us
STR-1:

KEY-527587: [%person#1-surname]: [%team#1-short] must reconsider ambitions
STR-1:

KEY-527588: [%person#1-I] don't really think this is the time or the place for that sort of question
STR-1:

KEY-527589: [%person#1-I] don't believe we froze or anything like that, we lost to the better team, and [%person#1-I]'m proud of [%person#1-my] players
STR-1:

KEY-527590: Winning was always going to be hard for us but [%person#1-I]'m proud of how we played in front of a crowd of that size in a stadium like this
STR-1:

KEY-527591: We showed spirit and tenacity and that's what [%person#1-I] was looking for. It's not easy to come here and deal with that sort of crowd
STR-1:

KEY-527592: Playing in front of such a big crowd isn't easy but [%person#1-I]'m pleased with the spirit and application we displayed
STR-1:

KEY-527593: Maybe the stage was too big for us and we did struggle to impose ourselves with such a big crowd on hand. We'll go away and learn from these experiences
STR-1:

KEY-527594: It was a steep learning curve for all of us and, the next time we play in front of a crowd of that size, we'll be better for this experience
STR-1:

KEY-527595: It was chastening and definitely gave [%person#1-me] food for thought. Are we as a club ready for that sort of stage and playing in front of big crowds every week?
STR-1:

KEY-527596: Perhaps we need to reconsider our ambitions and targets as a club. [%person#1-I] don't think we're as ready for that sort of crowd and stage as we maybe thought we were
STR-1:

KEY-527597: How do [%person#1-you] feel about facing off against [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-527598: What are [%person#1-your] thoughts about playing a team like [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-527599: They're among the best teams we'll play and [%person#1-I]'m under no illusions about how hard they're going make life for us
STR-1:

KEY-527600: [%person#1-I] think we're playing a team with the ability to challenge us in a number of ways. This is going to be very tough for us
STR-1:

KEY-527601: Do [%person#1-you] have a team [%person#1-you]'d like to face in the next round?
STR-1:

KEY-527602: Is [%male#2] likely to be fit to feature against [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-527603: Are you expecting [%male#2] to return against [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-527604: [%person#1-I]'m confident that he'll be available for selection
STR-1:

KEY-527605: Do [%person#1-you] have an update on [%male#2]{s} injury?

KEY-527607: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] will be back soon
STR-1:

KEY-527608: [%person#1-surname] expects [%male#2-surname] to return soon
STR-1:

KEY-527609: [%male#2-surname] still not fit, says [%person#1-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-527610: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] return not imminent
STR-1:

KEY-527611: [%person#1-I]'m always reluctant to talk about injuries because anything [%person#1-I] say will create a level of expectation unfair to the player
STR-1:

KEY-527612: [%person#1-I]'m expecting him back pretty soon and it'll be great to have him available again
STR-1:

KEY-527613: He'll be back pretty soon, we're not worried about his recovery
STR-1:

KEY-527614: [%person#1-I]'m expecting him back sooner rather than later, things are going well
STR-1:

KEY-527615: [%person#1-I]'d like to think we'll have him back in the relatively near future if all goes well
STR-1:

KEY-527616: He's still not fit; we're not worried, but he'll be out a little while longer
STR-1:

KEY-527617: [%person#1-I] believe he's still a little way off but he's making progress
STR-1:

KEY-527618: He's not going to be back any time soon, so we have to manage the situation accordingly
STR-1:

KEY-527619: We're not going to have him back any time soon
STR-1:

KEY-527620: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] recovering well
STR-1:

KEY-527621: [%person#1-surname] optimistic about [%male#2-surname]{s} recovery
STR-1:

KEY-527623: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] has a long road ahead of him
STR-1:

KEY-527624: [%person#1-I] think he's recovering well; it's not easy for him, but he's doing well and we can't wait to have him back
STR-1:

KEY-527625: Everyone's happy with how he's coming along; it was a bad injury but he's making good progress and recovering well
STR-1:

KEY-527626: Obviously he's going to be out for a while but [%person#1-I]'m optimistic that he'll recover well and in good time
STR-1:

KEY-527627: [%person#1-I]'m optimistic that he'll be back to full fitness in good time. He's got a way to go yet but he's getting there
STR-1:

KEY-527628: He'll still be out for a while, we're not going to rush him back
STR-1:

KEY-527629: We have to be patient with injuries like the one he sustained, we know he'll be out for a while, and we'll help him in every way possible
STR-1:

KEY-527630: He has a long road ahead of him and the most important thing is making sure we give him our full support in his recovery
STR-1:

KEY-527631: [%person#1-I]'m not counting on having him back any time soon. He has a long road ahead and will be focusing on rehab
STR-1:

KEY-527632: When do [%person#1-you] expect [%male#2] back from injury? Will he be available to play against [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-527633: Do [%person#1-you] have a date in mind for [%male#2]{s} return from injury? Is the match against [%team#2-short] realistic?
STR-1:

KEY-527634: [%person#1-surname] wants [%male#2-surname] back for [%team#2-short] clash
STR-1:

KEY-527635: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] close to return
STR-1:

KEY-527636: [%male#2-surname] 'doubtful' to return soon
STR-1:

KEY-527637: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] still out
STR-1:

KEY-527638: [%person#1-I]'m not sure, we'll have to wait and see

KEY-527641: He's close to being back but [%person#1-I]'m not sure he'll be ready in time for that match
STR-1:

KEY-527642: [%person#1-I] think he's close but he might not be available that soon
STR-1:

KEY-527643: He's not quite there yet; [%person#1-I] would certainly doubt being able to have him for that match
STR-1:

KEY-527644: [%person#1-I]'d say he's pretty doubtful for that match. He's not far off but there's still a little work for him to do
STR-1:

KEY-527645: He's still out and working his way back to full fitness
STR-1:

KEY-527646: We're not going to have him back that soon, he still has some work to do to get back to where we need him to be
STR-1:

KEY-527647: When do [%person#1-you] expect [%person_list#1] back from injury? Will they be available to play against [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-527648: Do [%person#1-you] have a date in mind for [%person_list#1] returning from injury? Is the match against [%team#2-short] realistic?

KEY-527660: They're still out and working their way back to full fitness
STR-1:

KEY-527661: We're not going to have them back that soon, they still have some work to do to get back to where we need them to be
STR-1:

KEY-527662: Will [%male#2] be going straight back into the team after injury given his importance to [%person#1-your] plans?
STR-1:

KEY-527663: As one of [%team#1-short]{s} key players, will [%person#1-you] be restoring [%male#2] straight back into the team when he returns from injury?
STR-1:

KEY-527664: [%person#1-surname]: We need [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-527665: [%person#1-surname] set to unleash [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-527666: [%male#2-surname] 'must be patient', says [%person#1-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-527667: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] must earn his place
STR-1:

KEY-527668: [%person#1-I]'d rather not get in to hypothetical discussions right now. Let's see what happens
STR-1:

KEY-527669: We need him so, as long as he's fit, [%person#1-I]'m going to use him
STR-1:

KEY-527670: He's one of our best players and we need him. He'll play
STR-1:

KEY-527671: [%person#1-I] think it's clear that he makes us a better team so, when he's ready, we look forward to welcoming him back
STR-1:

KEY-527672: [%person#1-I] want him back in the team as soon as possible because he makes us a better team
STR-1:

KEY-527673: [%person#1-I]'m just as eager to see him return as everyone else but he has to be patient. We don't want to rush him back before he's properly ready
STR-1:

KEY-527674: We all want him back but this is the time to be patient. If we rush things we could end up regretting it
STR-1:

KEY-527675: He has to earn his place in the team just like everyone else. That's how it will always be here
STR-1:

KEY-527676: Nobody is guaranteed anything at this club. He'll have to earn his place just like before
STR-1:

KEY-527677: Presumably [%male#2] will be eased back into the team when he returns from injury?
STR-1:

KEY-527678: How will [%person#1-you] handle [%male#2]{s} return to the team after injury? Will he be phased back into the fold?
STR-1:

KEY-527679: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] set to play
STR-1:

KEY-527680: [%person#1-surname] keen for [%male#2-surname] to return
STR-1:

KEY-527681: [%male#2-surname] to take patient approach with [%person#1-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-527682: [%person#1-I] think it makes sense to be cautious but, by the same token, if he's available, he's going to play
STR-1:

KEY-527683: We'll be sensible with him but, if we need him and he's fit, he'll play
STR-1:

KEY-527684: [%person#1-I] actually think we could do with him as soon as possible so, all being well, that might be the case
STR-1:

KEY-527685: We'll take it game by game but, as long as he's ready, there's no reason to think he won't be involved early and often
STR-1:

KEY-527686: Yeah, [%person#1-I] think we need to be patient with him, and we're in a position where we can afford to be too
STR-1:

KEY-527687: [%person#1-I] always want to be patient and cautious with players coming back from injury, so that makes sense for us in this situation
STR-1:

KEY-527688: Will [%person#1-you] perhaps give [%male#2] some minutes in the [%team#3-typeonly] team to build his match sharpness back up?
STR-1:

KEY-527689: Could [%male#2] get some [%team#3-typeonly] minutes to get him back to full match sharpness?
STR-1:

KEY-527690: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] to play for [%team#3-typeonly] team
STR-1:

KEY-527691: [%person#1-surname] expects [%male#2-surname] to build fitness

KEY-527692: [%male#2-surname] might not need [%team#3-typeonly] minutes before return
STR-1:

KEY-527693: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] ready to go
STR-1:

KEY-527694: We'll have those conversations soon and decide on a plan of action
STR-1:

KEY-527695: [%person#1-I] believe that's the plan; he'll get some time on the pitch to shake off the rust
STR-1:

KEY-527696: We'll certainly give him the opportunity to get back out on the pitch and find form and fitness again
STR-1:

KEY-527697: It's one option we're considering but, yes, it does make sense for us to find ways to get him back out on the pitch in a different environment
STR-1:

KEY-527698: We're looking at different ways to get him back to fitness and that's definitely an option
STR-1:

KEY-527699: [%person#1-I]'m not so sure he needs to; he looks pretty good right now
STR-1:

KEY-527700: [%person#1-I] wouldn't rule it out but he's further along than we thought he'd be right now
STR-1:

KEY-527701: He's ready to go and we'll be getting him back into the first team fold in the very near future
STR-1:

KEY-527702: He doesn't need it, he's ready to go
STR-1:

KEY-527703: Is there a chance that [%male#2] will be loaned out to get him the regular playing time he needs upon returning from injury?
STR-1:

KEY-527704: Are [%person#1-you] considering a loan for [%male#2] to get him the playing time he needs after such a long time out?
STR-1:

KEY-527705: [%person#1-surname] set to loan out [%male#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-527706: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] could benefit from loan

STR-1:

KEY-527708: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] is staying
STR-1:

KEY-527709: We're in talks about the best way to bring him back to form and fitness but we've made no decisions yet
STR-1:

KEY-527710: [%person#1-I] think it's a great idea and one we're seriously considering
STR-1:

KEY-527711: Yeah, a loan move could be just what he needs to get himself back to the levels we know he's capable of reaching
STR-1:

KEY-527712: He could certainly benefit from a loan if he plays regularly. We're thinking about it
STR-1:

KEY-527713: [%person#1-I] can see the benefits from a loan move where he gets to play every week, so it's something we're thinking about
STR-1:

KEY-527714: [%person#1-I] don't know, there's some risk in putting him into a new environment where we can't manage his comeback properly. We'll have to wait and see
STR-1:

KEY-527715: [%person#1-I] get why people think it makes sense but [%person#1-I] also think we can achieve many of the same things by keeping him here and bringing him along at our pace
STR-1:

KEY-527716: He's not going anywhere, we'll be keeping him here and giving him plenty of playing time
STR-1:

KEY-527717: He doesn't need to go on loan, we'll be giving him plenty of football
STR-1:

KEY-527718: Does the injury to [%male#2] alter [%person#1-your] plans for the forthcoming transfer window?
STR-1:

KEY-527719: Will [%person#1-you] be using the forthcoming transfer window to address the hole [%male#2]{s} injury left in [%person#1-your] squad?
STR-1:

KEY-527720: [%person#1-surname] searching for [%male#2-surname] replacement
STR-1:

KEY-527721: [%person#1-surname] to turn to market after [%male#2-surname] injury
STR-1:

KEY-527722: [%male#2-surname] injury 'doesn't change our plans', says [%person#1-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-527723: [%person#1-surname]: Business as usual
STR-1:

KEY-527724: We haven't made any decisions yet
STR-1:

KEY-527725: [%person#1-I] think we have to change course; it's hard to replace a player of his quality, but we'll try
STR-1:

KEY-527726: It's clear we'll need to do something, so we'll take a look and see what we can do
STR-1:

KEY-527727: It's definitely given us something else to think about for that transfer window
STR-1:

KEY-527728: If the market is there to help us out, we'll have to give it some thought
STR-1:

KEY-527729: It doesn't change our plans; we're always prepared for anything and everything
STR-1:

KEY-527730: We go into each transfer window with a broad range of things to tackle, including emergencies like this, so it hasn't changed our plans
STR-1:

KEY-527731: It's business as usual as far as [%person#1-I]'m concerned. We don't have to use the market to replace him
STR-1:

KEY-527732: We think we can take care of replacing him without turning to the market. It's business as usual here
STR-1:

KEY-527733: How big of a challenge does [%male#2] face in getting his place back from [%male#3], who has impressed in his injury-enforced absence?
STR-1:

KEY-527734: Do [%person#1-you] face a potential selection headache when [%male#2] returns from injury considering how good [%male#3] has been in his absence?

KEY-527735: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] adds quality to the team

STR-1:

KEY-527739: We'll see what happens when he's actually back playing
STR-1:

KEY-527740: [%person#1-I] don't think it's a problem at all. We get a quality player back and our team will be much stronger for his return
STR-1:

KEY-527741: It's not a headache at all for us to welcome a quality player back into the fold. Think of the possibilities!
STR-1:

KEY-527742: [%person#1-I] can't wait to have him back, it's exciting, and we can easily accommodate both players
STR-1:

KEY-527743: [%person#1-I]'m excited, [%person#1-I] want as many good players here as possible, and they can certainly co-exist in the same team
STR-1:

KEY-527744: Well, he has to fight for his place now, but that's always been the case here. Nobody's spot is guaranteed
STR-1:

KEY-527745: He knows better than anyone else that he has to fight for his place, but that's not new to him, or anyone else here for that matter
STR-1:

KEY-527746: He has to start all over again and work hard to prove himself deserving of a place in the team
STR-1:

KEY-527747: It's an unfortunate fact that injuries often mean the player has to start over again and prove that he's worth a place in the team
STR-1:

KEY-527748: Are [%person#1-you] worried about the prospect of a shock result against [%team#2-short]?
STR-1:

KEY-527749: Are [%team#2-short] the sort of team that worries [%person#1-you] about the potential of what would be a huge upset result?
STR-1:

KEY-527750: We're taking nothing for granted and we'll give them all the respect they deserve, but we're confident in our own ability
STR-1:

KEY-527751: [%person#1-I] think we'll be fine as long as we treat the match with the usual respect
STR-1:

KEY-527752: Does this upcoming Fan Day at [%team#1-short] provide an opportunity for [%person#1-your] team to impress in front of a larger crowd than usual?
STR-1:

KEY-527753: How much are [%person#1-your] players looking forward to the upcoming Fan Day and playing in front of a bigger crowd?
STR-1:

KEY-527754: [%person#1-surname] excited to welcome more fans
STR-1:

KEY-527755: [%person#1-surname]: We want to put on a show
STR-1:

KEY-527756: [%person#1-surname] hopes fans return after Fan Day
STR-1:

KEY-527757: [%person#1-surname] fears weight of expectation
STR-1:

KEY-527758: [%person#1-I] don't think we're treating the match any differently to usual
STR-1:

KEY-527759: [%person#1-I]'m excited and so are all the players. This is a great chance for us to capture the attention and make memories from
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-527762: We want to go out and put on a show, make a real day of it
STR-1:

KEY-527763: This is a chance not just for us to impress, but also for the fans to prove to us that they're willing to return next time. Hopefully it's not a one-off
STR-1:

KEY-527764: [%person#1-I] think it's just as much of an opportunity for the fans to make sure they play their part in returning here week after week to give us an even bigger crowd
STR-1:

KEY-527765: There's always the flip side where we might struggle under the weight of increased expectation, so we have to be guarded against that
STR-1:

KEY-527766: [%person#1-I] think it'll be a good day for the fans, but we have to make sure we're focused, and don't find that we crumble under the weight of expectation
STR-1:

KEY-527767: How excited are [%person#1-you] to play in front of a bigger [%stadium#1] crowd now the expansion work has been completed?

STR-1:

KEY-527772: [%person#1-surname] hoping for 'business as usual' at [%stadium#1]
STR-1:

KEY-527773: [%person#1-I] haven't really given it that much thought to be perfectly honest
STR-1:

KEY-527774: [%person#1-I] think it's a great day for the club, a lot of work has gone into it, and this place can become a real fortress for us now
STR-1:

KEY-527775: [%person#1-I] want [%stadium#1] to be a real fortress for us. The addition of even more fans will help us achieve that goal
STR-1:

KEY-527776: [%person#1-I]'ll be pleased to welcome more fans through the doors; it's the next step for this club on and off the pitch
STR-1:

KEY-527777: [%person#1-I] know that we're all excited and it's always a great day when you can welcome more fans to the club and grow both on and off the pitch
STR-1:

KEY-527778: It's not something we've thought very much about. It's a bigger day for the fans and for other departments at the club
STR-1:

KEY-527779: We're focusing on the football side and we'll leave the rest up to everyone else. It'll be nice for those fans who've found it hard to get tickets to now have a better chance though
STR-1:

KEY-527780: Hopefully it's business as usual for us. We might have some more fans in the ground but the objective never changes
STR-1:

KEY-527781: Whether we play in front of one fan or one million fans, the job is the same. It's business as usual for us
STR-1:

KEY-527782: Are there particular challenges for [%person#1-your] players in facing [%team#2-short] in front of a much bigger crowd at [%stadium#2]?
STR-1:

KEY-527783: What are [%person#1-your] thoughts about playing at [%stadium#2] in front of a significantly bigger crowd than [%person#1-your] players are used to?

STR-1:

KEY-527785: [%person#1-surname] keen to impress on big stage

STR-1:

KEY-527787: [%person#1-surname] fears [%team#1-short] could freeze on big stage
STR-1:

KEY-527788: It really makes no difference to us
STR-1:

KEY-527789: These matches are what we live for and why we all wanted to be footballers. It's a grand stage and we're ready to play on it
STR-1:

KEY-527790: If these matches don't excite you then you're in the wrong sport. We're ready to show everyone what we can do on this sort of stage
STR-1:

KEY-527791: [%person#1-I] think everyone's keen to impress. This is a chance to show everyone who we are
STR-1:

KEY-527792: Opportunities like these don't come along very often and it's a chance for every one of us to show what we're all about
STR-1:

KEY-527793: It's definitely going to be a bit different for us, so we have to prepare well, and give it our best
STR-1:

KEY-527794: If we prepare well and make sure we're ready for anything, then we've got a chance of doing ourselves justice
STR-1:

KEY-527795: It's not something we've spoken about, but we all know the pitfalls of this sort of occasion. None of us want to freeze under the bright lights
STR-1:

KEY-527796: Nobody knows how they'll react when the spotlight is on them and we have to be ready for anything. [%person#1-I]'ll readily admit [%person#1-I] could freeze under pressure
STR-1:

KEY-527797: [%male#2] has been in good form of late and starts again today. How happy have [%person#1-you] been with his form?

STR-1:

KEY-527806: He deserves a lot of praise for the way he's approaching his craft at the minute and [%person#1-I] hope it continues
STR-1:

KEY-527807: He's playing well and deserves to be praised for that. [%person#1-I] hope he can put in another strong display here
STR-1:

KEY-527808: [%person#1-I] like the way he's been playing, and now [%person#1-I] want to see him produce that level of consistency week after week
STR-1:

KEY-527809: He's doing very well; [%person#1-I] want to make sure he's in a position to maintain this for as long as possible
STR-1:

KEY-527810: We've seen the level he can play at in the last few weeks. Now [%person#1-I] want to know how much better he can become
STR-1:

KEY-527811: [%person#1-I]'m always looking to challenge [%person#1-my] players to be even better so, for him now, it's about taking this good form and building on it
STR-1:

KEY-527812: [%person#1-You]'ve chosen to stick with [%male#2] today despite a questionable run of form. Why have [%person#1-you] picked him?
STR-1:

KEY-527813: Why have [%person#1-you] kept faith with [%male#2] despite a very clearly disappointing run of recent form on his part?

STR-1:

KEY-527817: [%person#1-surname]: [%male#2-surname] running out of chances
STR-1:

KEY-527818: [%person#1-I]'m the manager, [%person#1-I] get to pick the team
STR-1:

STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-527884: [%person#1-I] think some people still believe it's possible to plug in a tactic and stick with it forever. That's not how football works now; we need to tailor our appoach to each opponent

KEY-527885: Part of [%person#1-my] job is to make sure we're constantly evolving and finding new ways to play. That's all [%person#1-I]'m going to say

STR-1:

KEY-527887: [%male#2] makes his [%team#1-short] debut today and he does so in a new system for [%person#1-you]. Is there a risk of [%person#1-you] over-thinking this?

STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-527898: [%person#1-I]'ve changed things up before, [%male#2-first] has nothing to do with it. [%person#1-I] think everyone's guilty of overanalysing things

STR-1:

KEY-527900: [%person#1-I] don't have to answer to anyone except [%person#1-my] employers. Let's see what people are saying at the end of the match

KEY-528435: We are very pleased to be rid of [%person#2-you] and that we no longer have to work together.
STR-1:

KEY-528436: We believe it's important to stay on good terms with [%person#2-you], so hopefully we can continue to work together to build a positive future for this club.
STR-1:

KEY-528437: Let's hope the next time we have a meeting it goes a lot better than this one.
STR-1:

KEY-528438: That sounds fair to [%person#1-me].
STR-1: Điều đó nghe có vẻ ổn với tôi đấy.

KEY-528439: We sincerely hope [%person#2-you] get the job done.
STR-1:

KEY-528440: We'll allow [%person#2-you] more time but we will need [%number#1] points from the next 5 matches if [%person#2-you]'re to keep [%person#2-your] job.
STR-1:

KEY-528441: It's a real shame that we were unable to come to an agreement here.
STR-1:

KEY-528442: It's very disappointing that we've not been able to agree on things.
STR-1:

KEY-528443: [%person#1-I] haven't been in management that long and [%person#1-I] would appreciate some patience and understanding.
STR-1:

KEY-528444: We've taken that into consideration but would still like to know how [%person#2-you] plan to turn things around.
STR-1:

KEY-528445: Enough excuses; how are [%person#2-you] going to improve this situation?
STR-1:

KEY-528446: We've had a lot of injuries and [%person#1-I] need more time to fix the damage they've inflicted.
STR-1:

KEY-528447: We've had a really hard fixture list recently. Can we see how things go now it's eased a bit?
STR-1:

KEY-528448: Give [%person#1-me] a month to improve the situation.
STR-1:

KEY-528449: What do [%person#1-I] need to do to stay in charge?
STR-1:

KEY-528450: Ignore the form; we're playing well and that will eventually shine through. Trust the process.
STR-1:

KEY-528451: We'll give [%person#2-you] the benefit of the doubt right now but we'll need to see results improve sooner rather than later.
STR-1:

KEY-528452: Why did [%person#2-you] feel the need to publicly criticise the board's actions?
STR-1:

KEY-528453: Can we start to look for a new affiliate club please? It'd help when sending players out on loan.
STR-1:

KEY-528454: [%person#2-You] can loan players out to any club, we don't need to explore affiliations.
STR-1:

KEY-528455: We have enough partnerships as it is, we don't need another one.
STR-1:

KEY-528456: It might be worth exploring partnership opportunities with clubs in other countries to boost our international profile.
STR-1:

KEY-528457: That's a really good idea, we'll start our investigations shortly, thanks!
STR-1: Đó là một ý tưởng thực sự hay, chúng tôi sẽ bắt đầu cuộc điều tra của mình trong thời gian ngắn, cảm ơn!

KEY-528458: If we're able to set up a partnership with a club that would secure us first option on talented youngsters it'd be a smart piece of business.
STR-1:

KEY-528459: [%person#2-You] have plenty of young players here to develop and improve.
STR-1:

KEY-528460: [%person#1-I] think it's worth seeking out a new affiliate partnership so we can expand the club's scouting network and knowledge.
STR-1:

KEY-528461: That sounds like a good idea. Would [%person#2-you] be interested in choosing the club we seek to partner with?
STR-1:

KEY-528462: Absolutely! That's be great.
STR-1:

KEY-528463: Excellent, we'll make arrangements to follow up on this in a few days.
STR-1:

KEY-528464: Having an affiliate to trust with our loanees makes the process a lot easier and is more beneficial for younger players to develop.
STR-1:

KEY-528465: We still don't believe it's worth the extra undertaking, sorry.
STR-1:

KEY-528466: [%person#1-I]'m all about youth development, but there are players out there who are worth signing too. We shouldn't be so insular in our approach.
STR-1:

KEY-528467: [%person#1-I] was thinking it might be worth seeking a partnership with a club that improves our chances of signing talented youngsters from abroad.
STR-1:

KEY-528468: We're happy with our current youth recruitment framework, thanks.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-528469: We have a comprehensive and robust youth recruitment policy in place and we don't feel the need to change it.
STR-1:

KEY-528470: We're happy with our recruitment model and do not feel the need to expand it right now.
STR-1:

KEY-528471: We're happy with the range and scope of our scouting network, thanks.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-528472: [%person#1-I]'m always trying to find ways to improve and believe the board should be doing the same thing.
STR-1:

KEY-528473: We're happy with the way things are, thanks.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-528474: It might make sense for the club to arrange a partnership that would allow us to sign good players on loan without having to absorb the cost of their wages.
STR-1:

KEY-528475: That makes a lot of sense, we'll make arrangements accordingly.
STR-1:

KEY-528476: Having to rely on loanees isn't something we want for the club.
STR-1:

KEY-528477: If we can arrange the right affiliation with the right team, we could boost our income a little bit more.
STR-1:

KEY-528478: We're always willing to explore ways to bring more money in, so we'll definitely set about trying to find a suitable club.
STR-1:

KEY-528479: It wouldn't make much difference and we'd be at the behest of bigger teams more often than we'd like, so we'd prefer not to do that.
STR-1:

KEY-528480: If there's money to be made then surely we owe it to ourselves to at least try?
STR-1:

KEY-528481: Our independence is more important than anything else, and we're not going to negotiate on that.
STR-1:

KEY-528482: There aren't enough players of the required standard available for us to be able to arrange a trial day right now.
STR-1:

KEY-528483: Having more first team coaches would be a great help for us to be able to increase our specialisation in training.
STR-1:

KEY-528484: If we could have more coaches for the [%team#3-typeonly] team it'd be great for increasing specialised work.
STR-1:

KEY-528485: That makes sense; please, go ahead and hire new coaches where necessary.
STR-1:

KEY-528486: We have enough coaches on the staff already for specialised coaching to already take place.
STR-1:

KEY-528487: The first team coaching staff are overworked right now; if we could bring some more coaches in it'd help everyone.
STR-1:

KEY-528488: If we could hire some more first team coaches it'd help with the workload and also improve performance levels across the board.
STR-1:

KEY-528489: We give players a lot of good reasons to come here already; it's a stretch to suggest improved coaching would help that much, if at all.
STR-1:

KEY-528490: We could really improve our specialisation in training if we have more first team coaches.
STR-1:

KEY-528491: Coaching is integral to our success so, if [%person#2-you] say it's needed, we'll grant that request.
STR-1:

KEY-528492: There are enough coaches at the club for anything to be possible already.
STR-1:

KEY-528493: [%person#1-I] could do with more first team coaches to help reduce everyone's workload.
STR-1:

KEY-528494: Can we have more first team coaches please? It'd help to spread the workload better and maybe improve overall performance.
STR-1:

KEY-528495: Most of our rivals have more coaches and we can't afford to be left behind.
STR-1:

KEY-528496: We can't afford to expand the coaching team right now, sorry.
STR-1:

KEY-528497: Players have to train every day and they value good coaching; if we can improve in that area, this is a place they'll want to be or come to.
STR-1:

KEY-528498: The club is already an attractive proposition for any player and minor coaching adjustments wouldn't improve that much.
STR-1:

KEY-528499: We need to be at the forefront of talent identification and, to do that, we need to expand our scouting network.
STR-1:

KEY-528500: There are already enough scouts on the staff for suitably comprehensive coverage to be possible.
STR-1:

KEY-528501: [%person#1-I]'d like for us to have more knowledge of players in other countries and, to do that, we need to hire more scouts.
STR-1:

KEY-528502: We should be constantly trying to build and improve upon our database of identified talent and, for that to scale up, we need more scouts.
STR-1:

KEY-528503: We need more first team physios; our players are at an increased risk of injury because of the increased workload.
STR-1:

KEY-528504: The welfare of our players is of the utmost importance so, please, go ahead and hire more physiotherapists.
STR-1:

KEY-528505: There are enough physios here for the work to be handled properly.
STR-1:

KEY-528506: [%person#3] should go on a coaching course if possible, it'd be a boost to the quality and expertise of our staff.
STR-1:

KEY-528507: That sounds like a good idea, we're happy to sanction that.
STR-1:

KEY-528508: That makes perfect sense but [%person#3-first] doesn't have any interest in undertaking such a course.
STR-1:

KEY-528509: The club is not in a position to afford that right now, sorry.
STR-1:

KEY-528510: If we can raise the limit on physio wages we would be able to attract the best people for the job.
STR-1:

KEY-528511: If we can raise the limit on assistant manager wages we would be able to attract the best people for the job.
STR-1:

KEY-528512: If we can raise the limit on director of football wages we would be able to attract the best people for the job.
STR-1:

KEY-528513: Our current wage structure allows for high-calibre staff to be brought into the club.
STR-1:

KEY-528514: We're already spending a lot of money on staff wages and we're not comfortable increasing that right now.
STR-1:

KEY-528515: [%person#1-I] could do with a bit more room in the staff wage budget to help improve the quality of the coaching team and spread the workload better.
STR-1:

KEY-528516: [%person#1-I] could do with a bit more room in the staff wage budget to help improve the quality of the scouting team and spread the workload better.
STR-1:

KEY-528517: [%person#1-I] could do with a bit more room in the staff wage budget to help improve the quality of the physiotherapy team and spread the workload better.
STR-1:

KEY-528518: [%person#1-I]'d like to further [%person#1-my] development by going on a coaching course please.
STR-1:

KEY-528519: We'd be happy to grant that request, it's never a problem to improve [%person#2-your] skills.
STR-1:

KEY-528520: We'd like to be able to grant [%person#2-your] request but the club can't afford for [%person#2-you] to be regularly absent from training at the moment.
STR-1:

KEY-528521: We're not sure that would benefit the team right now.
STR-1:

KEY-528522: We have to be selfish here; we fear that if [%person#2-you] continue to make that sort of progress, the club could lose you to bigger and better opportunities.
STR-1:

KEY-528523: Look at the bigger picture; this would benefit the entire club, not just [%person#1-me].
STR-1:

KEY-528524: On balance, we simply can't bring ourselves to take that chance, sorry.
STR-1:

KEY-528525: If we could have more [%job#1-plural-lowercase] available for the [%team#3-typeonly_abb] it'd help everyone do their jobs better.
STR-1:

KEY-528526: If we could have more [%job#1-plural-lowercase] it would help us compile our reports quicker and more efficiently.
STR-1:

KEY-528527: We think the current staff numbers are perfectly fine.
STR-1:

KEY-528528: We shouldn't be selling [%male#3], he's too important for us to lose right now.
STR-1:

KEY-528529: That's fair enough, we'll pull out of talks and ensure he stays here.
STR-1:

KEY-528530: We appreciate [%person#2-your] comments but the offer is too good to turn down.
STR-1:

KEY-528531: [%person#1-I] think we'd get more for him if we kept him a while longer, he's only going to improve.
STR-1:

KEY-528532: Please reconsider blocking the potential signing of [%male#3]; he'd be a real asset to the club.
STR-1:

KEY-528533: Please reconsider blocking the potential signing of [%male#3]; he'd be an important player for the team from day one.
STR-1:

KEY-528534: Please reconsider blocking the potential signing of [%male#3]; he has the potential to be worth the fee ten times over.
STR-1:

KEY-528535: Please reconsider blocking the potential signing of [%male#3]; he'd go straight into the team.
STR-1:

KEY-528536: Please reconsider blocking the potential signing of [%male#3]; he'd be an absolute star here.
STR-1:

KEY-528537: If that's how [%person#2-you] feel, fair enough. We're happy for the transfer to proceed.
STR-1:

KEY-528538: We hear [%person#2-you], but the offer as it stands simply doesn't represent value for money.
STR-1:

KEY-528539: We hear [%person#2-you], but the transfer offer as it stands would simply cost the club too much money.
STR-1:

KEY-528540: [%person#1-I]'m disappointed and really would like the board to reconsider.
STR-1:

KEY-528541: Our decision is final.
STR-1:

KEY-528542: We'd be happy to allow the deal to proceed if the price was lower.
STR-1:

KEY-528543: We can't sanction the deal at the price already agreed.
STR-1:

KEY-528544: We can't sanction the deal at the price already agreed, it's far too high.
STR-1:

KEY-528545: His signing wouldn't align with our objectives.
STR-1:

KEY-528546: We want to sign young players for the future and he's simply too old.
STR-1:

KEY-528547: We don't want to be signing players from our rivals, so please look elsewhere for potential new signings.
STR-1:

KEY-528548: We're not prepared to negotiate; he should command a bigger fee than the one [%person#2-you] accepted.
STR-1:

KEY-528549: Please reconsider blocking [%male#3]{s} departure; he's not going to play for [%person#1-me].
STR-1:

KEY-528550: He is too good and too important to be sold that cheaply. At that price, we simply cannot let him leave.
STR-1:

KEY-528551: He has a role to play in [%person#2-your] squad and, at the current price, will not be allowed to leave.
STR-1:

KEY-528552: [%person#1-I] would like for [%male#3] to be sold as agreed; he's achieved all he can here and has limited potential to improve.
STR-1:

KEY-528553: He has plenty of room to improve and we'd rather not live to regret selling him at this point in his career.
STR-1:

KEY-528554: He wants to leave and none of us should stop him from doing that.
STR-1:

KEY-528555: We have to put the club's best interests first. He stays until a suitable offer is made for him.
STR-1:

KEY-528556: It's worth investing more in our junior coaching budget to help us produce the best possible home-grown talent.
STR-1:

KEY-528557: We spend enough money in the junior coaching department and we're satisfied with that right now.
STR-1:

KEY-528558: Other clubs are investing more and more in their junior coaching ranks and we need to keep up or be left behind.
STR-1:

KEY-528559: We're in a better position than most clubs and we will not be drawn into a spending competition.
STR-1:

KEY-528560: We already have a lot of youth players and we encourage [%person#2-you] to get the most out of them. Request denied.
STR-1:

KEY-528561: If we invest more money in our junior coaching, we'd be able to provide better individual coaching to our young players.
STR-1:

KEY-528562: We are already set up well in that area.
STR-1:

KEY-528563: It'd be great if we could scale up our youth recruitment network to improve the quality of players coming through the ranks.
STR-1:

KEY-528564: We want to have a strong and successful youth setup so we'd be happy to make that happen.
STR-1:

KEY-528565: Our recruitment network is fine for a club like ours, and we'd rather not change that right now.
STR-1:

KEY-528566: Improving our recruitment network will mean we're able to compete for the best young players with our rivals rather than missing out.
STR-1:

KEY-528567: This is a competitive region and we have to stay competitive.
STR-1:

KEY-528568: We should never be satisfied with what we have; this is an area we can make constant improvements in with huge benefits to doing so.
STR-1:

KEY-528569: [%person#2-Your] ambition is infectious and we're therefore happy to reconsider and invest as necessary.
STR-1:

KEY-528570: We're happy with our current setup.
STR-1:

KEY-528571: [%person#1-I] have experience at international level and [%person#1-I] think that's quite valuable.
STR-1:

KEY-528572: [%person#1-I]'m still pretty new to management, so [%person#1-I] lack experience, but make up for it in other ways.
STR-1:

KEY-528573: [%person#1-I] have a sufficiently impressive reputation that should make up for any supposed lack of experience.
STR-1:

KEY-528574: [%person#1-I] don't have the experience other managers have but [%person#1-I] do have a good track record so far.
STR-1:

KEY-528575: Hiring [%person#1-me] would be a risk, sure, but [%person#1-I] think it's a risk worth taking.
STR-1:

KEY-528576: [%person#1-I] think my standing in the game should quell any concerns, to be honest.
STR-1:

KEY-528577: This is the best chance [%person#1-I]'ve had to work in this country and [%person#1-I] hope to finally be given the opportunity.
STR-1:

KEY-528578: There isn't much loyalty left in football anymore but [%person#1-I] think it reflects well on [%person#1-me] that [%person#1-I]'ve shown plenty of it.
STR-1:

KEY-528579: Can [%person#2-you] ease our concerns that [%person#2-you] have never previously held a job in management?
STR-1:

KEY-528580: [%person#2-You] have never managed a club team before. Is this something we should be concerned about?
STR-1:

KEY-528581: Can [%person#2-you] ease our concerns about [%person#2-your] lack of experience?
STR-1:

KEY-528582: Are [%person#2-you] concerned that [%person#2-you] don't have all that much managerial experience?
STR-1:

KEY-528583: Can [%person#2-you] ease our concerns that [%person#2-you] have never previously managed in this country?
STR-1:

KEY-528584: What do [%person#2-you] think makes [%person#2-you] suited to managing a club of this stature?
STR-1:

KEY-528585: Do [%person#2-you] think it's a positive or a negative thing that [%person#2-you] have thus far managed just one team?
STR-1:

KEY-528586: Why has [%person#2-your] managerial career thus far lacked variety?
STR-1:

KEY-528587: Why have [%person#2-you] only worked with a small selection of teams so far in [%person#2-your] career?
STR-1:

KEY-528588: Why have [%person#2-you] moved between clubs so frequently?
STR-1:

KEY-528589: Can [%person#2-you] explain why [%person#2-you] have been sacked so often?
STR-1:

KEY-528590: Why do [%person#2-you] think [%person#2-you]'re yet to win a trophy?
STR-1:

KEY-528591: Are [%person#2-you] concerned that [%person#2-you]'ve not yet led a team to promotion?
STR-1:

KEY-528592: [%person#2-You]'ve been relegated a few times as a manager; why has that happened so often?
STR-1:

KEY-528593: [%person#2-Your] record of being relegated does give us cause for concern, can [%person#2-you] explain what's happened there?
STR-1:

KEY-528594: It's time for [%person#1-me] to take the next step and, hopefully, that can be here.
STR-1:

KEY-528595: Look at [%person#1-my] work, it shows [%person#1-I]'m ready for the opportunity to move up to a higher level.
STR-1:

KEY-528596: [%person#1-I]'m keen to keep progressing and [%person#1-I]'d love the opportunity to do that here.
STR-1:

KEY-528597: [%person#1-I] don't think it matters; [%person#1-my] focus is squarely on being the best manager [%person#1-I] can be.
STR-1:

KEY-528598: [%person#1-I]'ve done well there but it's time for [%person#1-me] to move on and take the next step.
STR-1:

KEY-528599: [%person#1-I] plan on bringing all that good momentum with [%person#1-me] to hit the ground running.
STR-1:

KEY-528600: Why do [%person#2-you] want to leave [%person#2-your] current job after doing so much good work there?
STR-1:

KEY-528601: Can [%person#2-you] offer us any assurances that [%person#2-you] have what it takes to make the jump to managing a club as big as ours?
STR-1:

KEY-528602: Why are [%person#2-you] thinking of making what some people would describe a sideways move in management?
STR-1:

KEY-528603: Are [%person#2-you] perhaps looking to move on from [%person#2-your] current job while things are going well and [%person#2-your] stock is high?
STR-1:

KEY-528604: We're targeting a playoff place; is that something [%person#2-you] think is attainable, or can [%person#2-you] take us further?
STR-1:

KEY-528605: We're targeting [%comp#3-short] qualification; is that something [%person#2-you] think is attainable, or can [%person#2-you] take us further?
STR-1:

KEY-528606: We're targeting a top half finish; is that something [%person#2-you] think is attainable, or can [%person#2-you] take us further?
STR-1:

KEY-528607: We're targeting a mid-table place; is that something [%person#2-you] think is attainable, or can [%person#2-you] take us further?
STR-1:

KEY-528608: We're targeting a mid-table finish; is that something [%person#2-you] think is attainable, or can [%person#2-you] take us further?
STR-1:

KEY-528609: We're aiming to stay clear of a relegation fight; is that something [%person#2-you] think is attainable, or can [%person#2-you] take us further?
STR-1:

KEY-528610: We don't want to get involved in a relegation scrap; is that something [%person#2-you] think can be avoided, or can [%person#2-you] take us further?
STR-1:

KEY-528611: We're aiming to avoid relegation; is that something [%person#2-you] think is attainable, or can [%person#2-you] take us further?
STR-1:

KEY-528612: We're expecting to avoid relegation; is that something [%person#2-you] think is attainable, or can [%person#2-you] take us further?
STR-1:

KEY-528613: We're expecting to avoid automatic relegation; is that something [%person#2-you] think is attainable, or can [%person#2-you] take us further?
STR-1:

KEY-528614: We're expecting to battle against relegation, is that realistic to [%person#2-you], or can [%person#2-you] aim higher?
STR-1:

KEY-528615: We want to finish in the top [%number#2-text], is that realistic to [%person#2-you], or can [%person#2-you] aim higher?
STR-1:

KEY-528616: We're expecting to win the title, is that realistic to [%person#2-you]?
STR-1:

KEY-528617: We're not expecting anything of [%person#2-you] this season; we'll discuss next season's objectives at a later date.
STR-1:

KEY-528618: [%person#1-I] think we could challenge for a playoff place.
STR-1:

KEY-528794: We're currently thinking of giving [%person#2-you] a wage budget of [%cash#1]. What do [%person#2-you] think of the proposed figure?
STR-1:

KEY-528795: A wage budget of [%cash#1] is on offer. What do [%person#2-you] think of the proposed figure?
STR-1:

KEY-528796: What do [%person#2-you] think of a proposed wage budget of [%cash#1]?
STR-1:

KEY-528797: Would a proposed wage budget of [%cash#1] be sufficient to achieve [%person#2-your] goals?
STR-1:

KEY-528798: Would a proposed wage budget of [%cash#1] be suitable to achieve [%person#2-your] goals?
STR-1:

KEY-528799: Okay, we'll talk again soon.
STR-1: Được rồi, sẽ sớm gặp lại ông.

STR-1: Cảm ơn vì điều đó. Có bất kỳ vấn đề gì cần thảo luận thì gọi cho tôi nhé.

KEY-528803: We have nothing more to discuss. I'll be leaving now.
STR-1: Chúng ta không còn gì để thảo luận nữa. Tôi sẽ đi ngay bây giờ.

KEY-528804: I think we're done here, I have more important things to do.
STR-1: Tôi nghĩ chúng ta đã xong việc ở đây, tôi còn nhiều việc quan trọng hơn phải làm.

KEY-528805: I'm disappointed with what has happened here and I don't see any reason to continue talking.
STR-1: Tôi thất vọng với những gì vừa xảy ra ở đây và tôi không thấy có lý do gì để tiếp tục nói chuyện với ông.

KEY-528806: If you could make a quick decision on your contract offer [%person#1-I]'d really appreciate it, thanks.
STR-1: Nếu bạn có thể đưa ra quyết định nhanh chóng về đề nghị hợp đồng của mình thì tôi thật sự đánh giá cao điều đó, cảm ơn.

KEY-528807: Alright, [%person#1-I] had to ask the question, but [%person#1-I] understand.
STR-1: Rồi, tôi hỏi thế thôi, giờ thì tôi hiểu.

KEY-528808: [%person#1-I] know it's hard, but [%person#1-I]'d really appreciate it if you could help us by coming to a decision sooner rather than later.
STR-1: Tôi biết là khó rồi, nhưng thật sự tôi đánh giá cao nếu bạn có thể giúp chúng tôi bằng cách đi đến quyết định sớm hơn là để muộn.

KEY-528809: Okay, [%person#1-I] understand, and [%person#1-I] won't press you further.
STR-1: Được rồi tôi hiểu và tôi sẽ không thúc ép bạn thêm nữa.

KEY-528810: [%person#1-I] don't want to annoy you but [%person#1-I] could do with you helping the club by making a quicker decision.
STR-1: Tôi không muốn làm phiền bạn nhưng thật sự là bạn có thể giúp CLB bằng cách đưa ra một quyết định nhanh hơn.

KEY-528811: Okay, see [%person#2-you] later.
STR-1: Ok, gặp lại sau.

KEY-528812: Cheers, I guess I'll be off then.
STR-1:

KEY-528813: Thanks boss, see [%person#2-you] later.
STR-1: Cảm ơn sếp, gặp ngài sau nhé.

KEY-528814: Bye then. Let me know if there's anything else [%person#2-you] need.
STR-1: Tạm biệt ông. Ông cần vấn đề gì thì gọi tôi luôn nhé.

KEY-528815: Whatever, I'm just going to go.
STR-1:

KEY-528816: I don't want to talk about this anymore. I'm off.
STR-1: Tôi không muốn nói về điều này nữa. Tôi đi đây.

KEY-528817: I'm done talking to [%person#2-you].
STR-1: Thôi tôi không có gì để nói với ông nữa.

KEY-528818: [%person#1-I] wanted to check in with you and find out how you are after your injury.
STR-1:

KEY-528819: [%person#1-I]'m here for you whenever; keep working hard and come back stronger.
STR-1:

KEY-528820: We're disappointed that [%person#2-you] caved in to player pressure and agreed to [%male#3]{s} demands about playing time. He doesn't deserve it at the minute and [%person#2-your] poor management is going to weaken the side.
STR-1:

KEY-528821: [%person#2-You]'re right, sorry for questioning [%person#2-you] boss, I'll concentrate on my football from now on.
STR-1:

KEY-528822: Sorry boss, I can see [%person#2-your] point of view now and I shouldn't have questioned [%person#2-you].
STR-1:

KEY-528823: [%person#2-You] need to think about the message that [%person#2-you]'re sending out with this, everyone in the squad is going to think they can get whatever they want by complaining.
STR-1:

KEY-528824: [%male#3] is exactly the sort of player we want at the club and we'd be delighted to handle transfer talks to try to bring him in.
STR-1:

KEY-528825: [%male#3] is exactly the sort of under-[%number#1] player we're looking to sign and we'd be delighted to look after transfer talks.
STR-1:

KEY-528826: [%male#3] is exactly the sort of under-[%number#1] player we're looking to sign for the future and we'd be delighted to look after transfer talks.
STR-1:

KEY-528827: We want to develop our own home-grown talent and we need the best youth recruitment to do that, so we'll happily accept that request.
STR-1:

KEY-528828: We want to develop our own home-grown talent and that does indeed need a higher youth coaching budget, [%person#2-you]'re right.
STR-1:

KEY-528829: We want to develop our own home-grown talent and we need the best youth facilities to do that, so we'll happily accept that request.
STR-1:

KEY-528830: We want to develop our own home-grown talent and we need the extra staff to do that, so we'll happily accept that request.
STR-1:

KEY-528831: [%person#2-You] have a budget that is perfectly good enough for [%person#2-you] to be successful with.
STR-1:

KEY-528832: Could [%person#1-I] please have an improved transfer budget? Without proper investment we're going to be consistently beaten to our targets.
STR-1:

KEY-528833: [%person#1-I] need a bigger transfer budget to make sure we're not beaten to our most important targets.
STR-1:

KEY-528834: Why are we limiting our own potential? Without proper investment like this [%person#1-I]'m convinced the club's reputation will suffer.
STR-1:

KEY-528835: The club is doing very well and [%person#2-your] comments are both disingenuous and not appreciated in the slightest.
STR-1:

KEY-528836: [%person#1-I] just feel such a small budget shows a lack of ambition, that's all.
STR-1:

KEY-528837: Spending money doesn't guarantee success; we've seen some of the biggest clubs suffer the consequences of overspending, and we're more interested in ensuring stability.
STR-1:

KEY-528838: [%person#1-I] would appreciate a little more help in the transfer budget to give us that extra push needed to secure promotion.
STR-1:

KEY-528839: We are currently running at a loss and simply cannot afford to spend more money, sorry.
STR-1:

KEY-528840: We will shortly be assessing the club's budgets, so please wait until then, thank you.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-528841: The budget was adjusted recently and we're not prepared to do so again this soon.
STR-1:

KEY-528842: [%person#1-I]'m asking for an increased wage budget to make sure we can attract the best players.
STR-1:

KEY-528843: The wage structure is good enough for [%person#2-you] to get business done.
STR-1:

KEY-528844: [%person#1-I] could do with a boost to the wage budget because of all the injuries we've suffered.
STR-1:

KEY-528845: If we haven't got the wage budget to pay our players properly, they'll go elsewhere.
STR-1:

KEY-528846: We recognise [%person#2-your] concerns but we have to put the club's financial stability first, and therefore we cannot increase the budget.
STR-1:

KEY-528847: [%person#1-I] really need a bigger wage budget; if we can't pay our players what they deserve, we're at risk of losing them.
STR-1:

KEY-528848: Until [%person#2-you] can offer a proper reason for spending more money on wages, we're unable to help.
STR-1:

KEY-528849: Most of those players have plenty of time left on their contracts, so there's no need for us to enter into negotiations right now.
STR-1:

KEY-528850: [%person#1-I] think our promotion chances would be helped considerably by a little boost to the wage budget.
STR-1:

KEY-528851: [%person#1-I] would appreciate a bigger wage budget to keep our best players here rather than having them leave on a free at the end of their contracts.
STR-1:

KEY-528852: There are no players to whom that situation would apply to right now, so we're not willing to grant [%person#2-your] request.
STR-1:

KEY-528853: We're not just talking about the best players, it's everyone. Without squad depth we're nothing.
STR-1:

KEY-528854: We feel the squad depth will be perfectly fine without changing the wage budget, sorry.
STR-1:

KEY-528855: Without the wage budget to spend on improving the squad, [%person#1-I] don't think [%person#1-I]'ll be able to keep the fans happy.
STR-1:

KEY-528856: The fans are happy, but spending more money on wages would be irresponsible regardless, and we cannot grant that request.
STR-1:

KEY-528857: [%person#1-I] could do with some more freedom in the transfer market and having a bigger percentage of transfer revenue allocated to the budget would be a big help.
STR-1:

KEY-528858: That makes sense and is easy for us to do, so we'll arrange for that to happen shortly.
STR-1:

KEY-528859: The current limits were imposed to ensure we remain financially secure, and we're not prepared to compromise on that right now.
STR-1:

KEY-528860: [%person#1-I]'d like to capitalise on the club's strong financial position by asking for more of the revenue to be added to the transfer budget.
STR-1:

KEY-528861: If we can't spend a little bit more than we run the risk of falling away and failing to meet our objectives.
STR-1:

KEY-528862: [%person#1-I] think we could achieve great things if we were able to sign [%male#3].
STR-1:

KEY-528863: He would be a fantastic addition and we're prepared to start work on a potential transfer.
STR-1:

KEY-528864: [%person#1-I] think that signing [%male#3] would be a real statement of intent on our part.
STR-1:

KEY-528865: We couldn't agree more and we're happy to begin negotiations as soon as possible.
STR-1:

KEY-528866: As nice as that would be, he just isn't a realistic target, and we can't commit money to what would be a fruitless endeavour in trying to sign him.
STR-1:

KEY-528867: If the board can get [%team#3-short] to agree to terms, [%person#1-I] believe [%male#3] would be interested in signing for us.
STR-1:

KEY-528868: [%person#2-You] should focus on more realistic targets, please.
STR-1:

KEY-528869: Spending big on one player isn't something that makes sense to us. We would far prefer the budget to be spread over several signings that can all help.
STR-1:

KEY-528870: Unfortunately, we just can't afford to spend the sort of money it'd take to get him.
STR-1:

KEY-528871: The current transfer budget is more than adequate.
STR-1:

KEY-528872: Why would we spend such a big sum of money on a player who doesn't move the needle for us?
STR-1:

KEY-528873: If [%person#1-I] get a bigger budget [%person#1-I]'m sure we can achieve greater things than we initially targeted.
STR-1:

KEY-528874: It's nice to see that [%person#2-you]'re confident, it gives us good reason to give [%person#2-you] the opportunity to get the players [%person#2-you] want.
STR-1:

KEY-528875: [%person#2-You] should focus on achieving our main objectives before looking too far ahead.
STR-1:

KEY-528876: The current transfer budget should be enough to get the deal done.
STR-1:

KEY-528877: [%person#1-I] don't want [%male#3] to sign for one of our rivals, we have to sign him. The transfer budget needs to be increased so we can get this deal done.
STR-1:

KEY-528878: [%male#3] is a terrific prospect who could also help us right now and we could make a lot of money on him eventually; [%person#1-I]'d like the transfer budget to be opened up so we can sign him please.
STR-1:

KEY-528879: [%person#2-You] seem to have this planned out quite well, so we're happy to give [%person#2-you] the money to get the deal done.
STR-1:

KEY-528880: That's too speculative for us to be able to agree with, so we cannot free up any more transfer money.
STR-1:

KEY-528881: [%person#1-I]'m prepared to beg if [%person#1-I] have to, it's that important.
STR-1:

KEY-528882: Given [%person#2-your] patchy transfer record, forgive us if we're not comfortable giving [%person#2-you] any more money.
STR-1:

KEY-528883: He doesn't represent an immediate and clear upgrade so we're not willing to spend any more money on him.
STR-1:

KEY-528884: He's a sure thing to get better and better. He'll be so important to us in no time at all.
STR-1:

KEY-528885: If [%person#2-you]'re sure, we're prepared to take a leap of faith and give [%person#2-you] benefit of the doubt, but we will handle transfer negotiations.
STR-1:

KEY-528886: [%person#2-You]'ve been less than convincing this season and we aren't prepared to hand [%person#2-you] more money until the situation improves.
STR-1:

KEY-528887: Can we go back in for [%male#3] please?  The deal fell through last time but he's still worth trying to sign.
STR-1:

KEY-528888: Next season's budget is more than adequate for the club's objectives.
STR-1:

KEY-528889: The club's current financial situation means we're unable to consider doing this right now, sorry.
STR-1:

KEY-528890: [%person#1-I] would appreciate an increased budget next season to make sure we keep moving forward; without more to spend, we could go backwards.
STR-1:

KEY-528891: [%person#1-I] would appreciate a little more help in the transfer budget next season to make sure we can be in for our key targets without losing out.
STR-1:

KEY-528892: We're doing ourselves no favours by imposing these limits, and it's the club's reputation that will ultimately suffer.
STR-1:

KEY-528893: We are running the club perfectly well and do not appreciate [%person#2-your] remarks.
STR-1:

KEY-528894: [%person#1-I] think people will question our ambition if we're not able to spend big. To be honest, [%person#1-I]'m questioning it [%person#1-myself].
STR-1:

KEY-528895: We are trying to run this club on a sensible and stable footing. Having seen the damage done at clubs that have overspent, we do not want to run the same risk.
STR-1:

KEY-528896: [%male#3] is incredibly important to this club and we should be doing everything we can to offer him the contract he wants.
STR-1:

KEY-528897: Absolutely, nobody here wants to lose him, so we will handle the necessary talks to get the deal done.
STR-1:

KEY-528898: We need to give [%male#3] the contract he's seeking because we might lose him on a free at the end of his current deal otherwise.
STR-1:

KEY-528899: There is enough flexibility in the budget to renew his contract right now.
STR-1:

KEY-528900: Our facilities are just fine, thank you.[%person#1-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-528901: [%person#1-I] think we should invest in improving our training facilities; it'll help boost our reputation and attract better players.
STR-1:

KEY-528902: [%person#1-I] think we could do with investing in modern technologies to improve our training facilities. It would help us in so many ways.
STR-1:

KEY-528903: We simply don't have confidence in [%person#2-you] at the moment and it would be remiss of us to accept any promises without the confidence in [%person#2-you] backing them up. At this moment in time we are going to have to reject [%person#2-your] request.
STR-1:

KEY-528904: We should invest in our youth facilities to give our young players the best possible chance of developing into first team stars.
STR-1:

KEY-528905: [%person#2-Your] main focus should be signing first-team ready players. We don't want to be relying on young players who aren't ready yet.
STR-1:

KEY-528906: Our current facilities are good enough.
STR-1:

KEY-528907: [%person#1-I] think we should invest in our youth facilities; we'd be doing ourselves a huge favour if we could improve our chances of developing high-level home-grown talent.
STR-1:

KEY-528908: [%person#1-I] really do think it's worth investing in youth development; the more time and money we put in, the more we get out.
STR-1:

KEY-528909: We want [%person#2-you] to focus on improving the team in the transfer market and we will not be granting [%person#2-your] request.
STR-1:

KEY-528910: [%person#1-I] want to point out that we have some fantastic young talent here and that the transfer market is just as fraught with risk.
STR-1:

KEY-528911: Ultimately, [%person#2-you]'re the manager, and if [%person#2-you] think this would help then we're willing to take a chance and trust [%person#2-your] judgement.
STR-1:

KEY-528912: [%person#1-I] would appreciate the club seeking to attain the next youth level up the ladder so we can continue to do everything possible to develop home-grown talent.
STR-1:

KEY-528913: Unfortunately, we just can't afford to do that right now.
STR-1:

KEY-528914: Hello! What can we do for [%person#2-you]?
STR-1:

KEY-528915: [%person#1-I] thought the board would show more ambition than this and [%person#1-I]'m very disappointed.
STR-1:

KEY-528916: After further consideration, we are prepared to give [%person#2-you] what [%person#2-you]'re asking for.
STR-1:

KEY-528917: That's unfair, we want nothing but the best for this club.
STR-1:

KEY-528918: The club will benefit hugely from the financial improvements this would provide.
STR-1:

KEY-528919: [%person#1-I] don't think [%person#1-I] can stay here if this isn't something the board are prepared to do.
STR-1:

KEY-528920: We'll be left behind by some of our biggest rivals if this doesn't happen.
STR-1:

KEY-528921: The financial rewards do not outweigh the risks, unfortunately.
STR-1:

KEY-528922: In that case, perhaps [%person#2-you] should indeed leave, as long as [%person#2-you]'re sure?
STR-1:

KEY-528923: This is really important and [%person#1-I] would really implore you to reconsider.
STR-1:

KEY-528924: We'll constantly be playing catch-up in the transfer market if this doesn't happen.
STR-1:

KEY-528925: With all due respect, [%person#2-your] protests won't change anything now.
STR-1:

KEY-528926: We believe the club will be just fine without the need to do this.
STR-1:

KEY-528927: [%person#1-I]'m very disappointed but [%person#1-I] respect the decision you've made.
STR-1:

KEY-528928: We need to do this to make sure our young players realise their potential at this club rather than somewhere else.
STR-1:

KEY-528929: We believe this club is ready and able to ensure every player realises their potential.
STR-1:

KEY-528930: [%person#1-I] don't want to leave. It's important that we have these discussions, and [%person#1-I] am passionate, but we can work together.
STR-1:

KEY-528931: Consider this [%person#1-me] handing in [%person#1-my] resignation.
STR-1:

KEY-528932: We place a high value on youth development and it's for that reason that we will not be accepting [%person#2-your] request.
STR-1:

KEY-528933: We know how important a strong youth development programme is to a club's success, so we'd be more than happy to make this happen.
STR-1:

KEY-528934: While the club's finances remain in the state they currently are, we cannot consider this.
STR-1:

KEY-528935: Please work with what [%person#2-you] have available to [%person#2-you] right now; it's not been long since [%person#2-you] joined the club.
STR-1:

KEY-528936: We can't do that because of our financial fair play restrictions, sorry.
STR-1:

KEY-528937: We're in good form and [%person#2-you]'ve played a big part in making that happen, so we're happy to grant [%person#2-your] request.
STR-1:

KEY-528938: [%person#1-I] will do whatever it takes to improve our performances and fortunes on the pitch.
STR-1:

KEY-528939: If [%person#2-you] keep [%person#2-your] promise, we'll be happy to action it at a later date.
STR-1:

KEY-528940: [%person#1-I]'ll back [%person#1-myself], thank you.
STR-1:

KEY-528941: Good stuff, we're looking forward to seeing [%person#2-you] succeed!
STR-1:

KEY-528942: We will be happy to make this official once [%person#2-you]'ve made good on [%person#2-your] promise.
STR-1:

KEY-528943: [%person#2-You] wanted to talk about [%person#2-your] recent request?
STR-1:

KEY-528944: We've only recently agreed a contract with [%person#2-you] so we'd ask that [%person#2-you]'d wait a while before requesting a new one.
STR-1:

KEY-528945: [%person#1-I] want to sign a new contract; it'd be a strong show of commitment if we're able to move forward together.
STR-1:

KEY-528946: We don't want to offer [%person#2-you] a new deal right now.
STR-1:

KEY-528947: [%person#1-I] want to sign a new contract; there are other clubs interested in [%person#1-my] services and though [%person#1-I] don't want to leave, a new deal sends a message.
STR-1:

KEY-528948: [%person#1-I] want to sign a new contract; [%person#1-I] want to build something here that stands the test of time and your support in doing that would be appreciated.
STR-1:

KEY-528949: [%person#1-I] think we could do with expanding the stadium; it'd help with the current demand for tickets.
STR-1:

KEY-528950: We're not sure that's such a good idea; the fan base isn't big enough to guarantee filling any extra capacity and it's too much of a risk for us to take.
STR-1:

KEY-528951: [%person#1-I] think the club should expand the stadium so it can make more money from ticketing revenue.
STR-1:

KEY-528952: [%person#1-I] think it's a good time to consider expanding the stadium. We're going to be increasingly successful and it's important to capitalise on that rather than react after the fact.
STR-1:

KEY-528953: We're no longer limited by anything so [%person#1-I] would like to revisit the idea of the club expanding the stadium.
STR-1:

KEY-528954: We aren't confident that we have enough fans to make any expansion worthwhile. We don't want empty seats at home games.
STR-1:

KEY-528955: [%person#1-I]'m no expert but surely it makes sense to think that a larger capacity invites more fans and therefore more money from tickets sold?
STR-1:

KEY-528956: [%person#1-You] had a lot of first team players away during the international break; how much of a problem does that pose for [%person#1-you] ahead of returning to club action?
STR-1:

KEY-528957: What are the challenges [%person#1-you] face returning for club action after having so many players away during the international break?
STR-1:

KEY-528958: [%person#1-surname] confident after international break
STR-1:

KEY-528959: [%team#1-short] 'will be ready', says [%person#1-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-528960: [%person#1-surname] on challenges of international break
STR-1:

KEY-528961: [%person#1-surname] 'not a fan' of international football
STR-1:

KEY-528962: [%person#1-I] don't want to keep going over this every time we break for internationals, it's boring
STR-1:

KEY-531357: I think we're all very happy that we're going to get a chance to impress.
STR-1:

KEY-531358: That's great to hear, thank [%person#2-you].
STR-1:

KEY-531359: I'm certainly very pleased that [%person#2-you]'ll be adding to the squad.
STR-1:

KEY-531360: We can only get better by bringing in more good players, so that's great news!
STR-1:

KEY-531361: It's nice to see a bit more realism in [%person#2-your] expectations this time.
STR-1:

KEY-531362: Excellent, we're finally in agreement about what's realistic to expect of this team.
STR-1:

KEY-531363: I don't understand why [%person#2-you]'re being even less ambitious, it's confusing.
STR-1:

KEY-531364: Do [%person#2-you] not believe in this team? Why else would [%person#2-you] set the bar even lower?
STR-1:

KEY-531365: It's nice to see a bit more ambition in [%person#2-your] expectations this time.
STR-1:

KEY-531366: Excellent, we're finally trying to be ambitious!
STR-1:

KEY-531367: Asking even more of us seems to be a recipe for failure if [%person#2-you] ask me.
STR-1:

KEY-531368: It's incredibly unfair of [%person#2-you] to keep asking more of us, particularly when the expectations are unrealistic.
STR-1:

KEY-531369: That still doesn't seem entirely realistic.
STR-1:

KEY-531370: I'm sorry, but those expectations are still unrealistic.
STR-1:

KEY-531371: [%person#2-You]'re still not being ambitious enough for me.
STR-1:

KEY-531372: We're capable of so much more than that, please try to be more ambitious.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-531373: We've all worked hard and we're seeing the rewards. Only good things can happen if we continue in that way!
STR-1:

KEY-531374: This is a style of play I certainly believe in and think will only serve to benefit us even more as we continue to work at it.
STR-1:

KEY-531375: Everyone knows that we need to strengthen the squad to improve, so that's very good news.
STR-1:

KEY-531376: Great news, new signings can only help us to get better!
STR-1:

KEY-531377: I think a few of us might be worried about the idea of new signings being brought in to replace us.
STR-1:

KEY-531378: There is a lot of talent in this team and I don't want it ignored for a flashy new signing who hasn't done anything in the game.
STR-1:

KEY-531379: I think all of us appreciate the chance to make amends for our disappointing season.
STR-1:

KEY-531380: It's great to hear that we'll be given a chance to rectify the mistakes of this season. I'm definitely up for it and won't be looking to leave.
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-531382: You all heard the boss, it's time to step up and show everyone what we can do.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-531383: Don't [%person#1-you] think that's a bit unfair? We're doing our best.
STR-1:

KEY-531384: We're doing as well as we can, why are [%person#1-you] not respecting that from [%person#1-your] team?
STR-1:

KEY-531385: We've not played anywhere near well enough and it's worrying that [%person#1-you] think we have.
STR-1:

KEY-531386: IF [%person#1-you] think we're in a good situation then maybe things are even more desperate than I thought.
STR-1:

KEY-531387: The boss is right, we're doing well, let's enjoy it![%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-531388: We're absolutely smashing it lately lads, be proud of yourselves!
STR-1:

KEY-531389: I'm not sure why [%person#1-you]'re praising us when we could be doing a lot better.
STR-1:

KEY-531390: Wait, [%person#1-you] want to praise us while we're playing like this? That doesn't make any sense.
STR-1:

KEY-531391: Sort it out lads, none of us have been good enough.
STR-1:

KEY-531392: This ultimately falls on all of us to sort out. We've all been rubbish and nobody can hide from that fact.
STR-1:

KEY-531393: Why do [%person#1-you] think criticising is going to suddenly make things better?
STR-1:

KEY-531394: Great, keep criticising us, that's going to end really well for [%person#1-you].
STR-1:

KEY-531395: We're closing in on the title, let's make sure we win it!
STR-1:

KEY-531396: We'll regret it forever if we don't see this through, come on lads, the title is at stake!
STR-1:

KEY-531397: It's on us to improve if we want to win the title, simple.
STR-1:

KEY-531398: No excuses, if we want to win the title we have to turn things around.
STR-1:

KEY-531399: [%person#1-You]'re being unfair; we're still in this title race but we don't need to be told we're playing badly when we're not.
STR-1:

KEY-531400: What are [%person#1-you] on about? We're doing well and remain in title contention. Stop causing problems.
STR-1:

KEY-531401: I don't know why [%person#1-you]'re telling us we're playing well when we're not.
STR-1:

KEY-531402: We're not playing well enough to stay up and [%person#1-you] know it.
STR-1:

KEY-531403: We have to improve if we want to stay up, simple.
STR-1:

KEY-531404: That's the truth right there. We're not doing enough to avoid relegation.
STR-1:

KEY-531405: We're good enough to turn things around and stay up, come on!
STR-1:

KEY-531406: Look around the room and look at the quality we have here. We can definitely stay up if we keep working hard.
STR-1:

KEY-531407: That's the right attitude, we're doing well, so let's make the most of it.
STR-1:

KEY-531408: Let's keep this going for as long as we can!
STR-1:

KEY-531409: We need hard truths and the fact is that we can't let this slump go on any longer.
STR-1:

KEY-531410: If we don't sort this out there'll be consequences for all of us.
STR-1:

KEY-531411: It's exciting to get the chance to work with [%person#2-you].
STR-1:

KEY-531412: I can't wait to get to work with someone with [%person#2-your] level of experience, it's incredibly exciting!
STR-1:

KEY-531413: It's a new adventure for all of us and I think we're all looking forward to working with [%person#2-you].
STR-1:

KEY-531414: It's a fresh start for all of us and [%person#2-you] have just as much potential as any one of us to help take this club to new heights!
STR-1:

KEY-531415: I understand that some people might have doubts about [%person#2-your] lack of experience but we're all prepared to give [%person#2-you] a chance and our support.
STR-1:

KEY-531416: I trust that [%person#2-you]'re the right person for the job even without that much experience. Let's work together to take this team to new heights!
STR-1:

KEY-531417: I think we're all really excited that [%person#2-you]'ve joined the club and the future looks very bright.
STR-1:

KEY-531418: It's an honour to have [%person#2-you] as our manager and we're going to have some great times under [%person#2-your] leadership!
STR-1:

KEY-531419: I think it's clear that [%person#2-you]'ll have to prove [%person#2-yourself] to quite a few of us but we're prepared to wait and see.
STR-1:

KEY-531420: I'll be honest; [%person#2-your] appointment hasn't filled us with confidence, and [%person#2-you]'ll have to work hard to change that.
STR-1:

KEY-531421: That's good to know, we all want to be as good as we can be.
STR-1:

KEY-531422: [%person#2-You]'re saying all the right things and hopefully we can do as well as [%person#2-you] think we can.
STR-1:

KEY-531423: We're all ready to get to work and I'm confident we can achieve our goals!
STR-1:

KEY-531424: Let's go! This is going to be the best season yet!
STR-1:

KEY-531425: I'm glad [%person#2-you]'re holding strong on [%person#2-your] aims for the season.
STR-1:

KEY-531426: It's good to see [%person#2-you] standing by [%person#2-your] ambitions!
STR-1:

KEY-531427: I really hoped [%person#2-you] might be more ambitious than that.
STR-1:

KEY-531428: It's concerning that [%person#2-you]'re already looking to take the easy way out. I thought we had an ambitious manager.
STR-1:

KEY-531429: That still isn't particularly realistic.
STR-1:

KEY-531430: [%person#2-You]'re still failing to grasp that these expectations aren't realistic.
STR-1:

KEY-531431: The Code of Conduct looks good to me.
STR-1:

KEY-531432: That's a good and fair Code of Conduct, that's great to see.
STR-1:

KEY-531433: I don't think many of us expected it to be so strict.
STR-1:

KEY-531434: Why is it so strict? We didn't expect this from the Code of Conduct.
STR-1:

KEY-531435: That all looks fine, none of us are going out there looking to fall foul of the Code of Conduct anyway.
STR-1:

KEY-531436: I'm happy with that for a Code of Conduct.
STR-1:

KEY-531437: I don't think many of us expected it to be so lenient.
STR-1:

KEY-531438: Why is it so lenient? That's concerning to me at least.
STR-1:

KEY-531439: Why is it so lenient? It hardly seems worth having a Code of Conduct if this is how it's going to look.
STR-1:

KEY-531440: I'm happy with that, let's talk about our targets for next season.
STR-1:

KEY-531441: Yep, it's important for us to set some sensible goals for next season.
STR-1:

KEY-531442: Absolutely. Promises aren't always easily defined, so we need some tangible targets for next season.
STR-1:

KEY-531443: We should talk about our expectations for next season so we all know where we stand.
STR-1:

KEY-531444: I agree, let's be positive and try to be as good as we can be.
STR-1:

KEY-531445: That's the spirit! It's going to be a great season!
STR-1:

KEY-531446: Can we not actually try to achieve something tangible?
STR-1:

KEY-531447: [%person#2-You]'re kidding, right? Can't we be ambitious?
STR-1:

KEY-531448: We can win this title!
STR-1:

KEY-531449: Yes! The title is there for us to win if we want it!
STR-1:

KEY-531450: Surely [%person#2-you] shouldn't be putting that sort of pressure on us?
STR-1:

KEY-531451: Why are [%person#2-you] putting all that pressure on us? It's not fair.
STR-1:

KEY-531452: We can win promotion!
STR-1:

KEY-531453: Yes! Promotion is there for us to win if we want it!
STR-1:

KEY-531454: Surely [%person#2-you] don't think we're good enough to go up?
STR-1:

KEY-531455: Come off it, we're not good enough to be getting promoted.
STR-1:

KEY-531456: We can stay up!
STR-1:

KEY-531457: Yes! We can definitely avoid relegation!
STR-1:

KEY-531458: I'm all for being optimistic but surely [%person#2-you] don't think we're good enough to stay up?
STR-1:

KEY-531459: Come off it, we all know we're favourites for relegation for a reason.
STR-1:

KEY-531460: Is that it? We're just going to be happy to stay up?
STR-1:

KEY-531461: Way to be optimistic! We're much better than limiting ourselves to a relegation fight.
STR-1:

KEY-531462: That's a target we can all get behind!
STR-1:

KEY-531463: Brilliant, we all know we're good enough to achieve that!
STR-1:

KEY-531464: I don't know, that seems unrealistic.
STR-1:

KEY-531465: We're not good enough to qualify, [%person#2-you]'re setting us up to fail.
STR-1:

KEY-531466: Can we not be a bit more ambitious please?
STR-1:

KEY-531467: Come on now, at least try to be ambitious.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-531468: I'm not sure we're good enough to achieve that.
STR-1:

KEY-531469: Come on, that's unrealistic. [%person#2-You]'re setting us up to fail.
STR-1:

KEY-531470: That doesn't seem ambitious enough for a team of our quality.
STR-1:

KEY-531471: I think that's a bit unrealistic to be honest.
STR-1:

KEY-531472: Come on now, be realistic. [%person#2-You]'re setting us up to fail.
STR-1:

KEY-531473: That doesn't seem particularly realistic.
STR-1:

KEY-531474: That doesn't seem ambitious enough for a team of our calibre.
STR-1:

KEY-531475: That's a bit unrealistic, don't [%person#2-you] think?
STR-1:

KEY-531476: Come on now, at least try to be realistic. [%person#2-You]'re setting us up to fail.
STR-1:

KEY-531477: Surely we can be more ambitious than that?
STR-1:

KEY-531478: At least try to show some ambition![%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-531479: I think that's a bit too optimistic.
STR-1:

KEY-531480: Come on now, be realistic! [%person#2-You]'re setting us up to fail.
STR-1:

KEY-531481: Can we at least try to be ambitious please?
STR-1:

KEY-531482: I think a team of our quality could be a bit more ambitious.
STR-1:

KEY-531483: Come on now, at least try to be ambitious![%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-531484: We're a good team and we should be able to be more ambitious than that.
STR-1:

KEY-531485: I think we can be more ambitious than that.
STR-1:

KEY-531486: Come on now, at least try to be realistic.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-531487: I don't think that's particularly realistic.
STR-1:

KEY-531488: That doesn't seem particularly ambitious for a team of our quality.
STR-1:

KEY-531489: Fair enough, I can see why that's a realistic aim.
STR-1:

KEY-531490: Alright then, I'm convinced. Let's do it!
STR-1:

KEY-531491: That still doesn't seem fair on us.
STR-1:

KEY-531492: [%person#2-You]'re still not being realistic.
STR-1:

KEY-531493: That sounds good to me.
STR-1:

KEY-531494: I'm really encouraged by that, it's great to hear!
STR-1:

KEY-531495: That sounds a little too ambitious right now.
STR-1:

KEY-531496: I don't think [%person#2-you]'re being either realistic or fair to any of us.
STR-1:

KEY-531497: [%person#2-You] aren't being ambitious enough if [%person#2-you] ask me.
STR-1:

KEY-531498: It's very disappointing that [%person#2-you] seem to lack ambition.
STR-1:

KEY-531499: We know what's expected of us, now it's time to deliver.
STR-1:

KEY-531500: We all expect to win the title so we have to make sure we get the job done.
STR-1:

KEY-531501: I don't think we were expected to win the title.
STR-1:

KEY-531502: I must be forgetting when we were told that we should be winning the title.
STR-1:

KEY-531503: It'd be nice not to have that pressure hanging over us. Can't we just focus on the football?
STR-1:

KEY-531504: [%person#2-You]'re not helping us by adding to the pressure. We know what's expected of us.
STR-1:

KEY-531505: We can do this, come on!
STR-1:

KEY-531506: It's all up to us now, but I believe we can do it, come on!
STR-1:

KEY-531507: Surely we should be happy enough being proud of how far we've come?
STR-1:

KEY-531508: None of us need to be told about what's at stake. How about focusing on how well we've done to get here?
STR-1:

KEY-531509: We don't need the added pressure, we know what's at stake.
STR-1:

KEY-531510: [%person#2-You] don't need to put any more pressure on us, that won't help.
STR-1:

KEY-531511: Do what we always do and let everything else take care of itself.
STR-1:

KEY-531512: Come on lads, shut out the noise and focus on ourselves!
STR-1:

KEY-531513: Come on, opportunities like this don't come along very often, we have to treat it differently.
STR-1:

KEY-531514: I don't know about [%person#2-you] but this match feels pretty big to me.
STR-1:

KEY-531515: Whatever happens, we've had a great season, so let's just give it what we've got left.
STR-1:

KEY-531516: If we win the title, great. If not, we've still had an incredible season!
STR-1:

KEY-531517: We all expect to get promoted so we have to make sure we get the job done.
STR-1:

KEY-531518: I think we've done well to even be in this position and there should be recognition for that.
STR-1:

KEY-531519: How about some praise and recognition for the work we've done to even be in this position?
STR-1:

KEY-531520: It doesn't help anyone to add to the pressure, come on.
STR-1:

KEY-531521: Why are [%person#2-you] piling the pressure on? What's that supposed to achieve?
STR-1:

KEY-531522: Come on everyone, we can do this, it'd be a great achievement!
STR-1:

KEY-531523: This is a brilliant opportunity for all of us to write our names in club history!
STR-1:

KEY-531524: We've done so much better than expected but it seems that's still not enough.
STR-1:

KEY-531525: After all the incredible work we've put in this season I can't believe [%person#2-you]'re putting the pressure on at a time like this.
STR-1:

KEY-531526: We know what's at stake, we don't need to be told.
STR-1:

KEY-531527: Everyone is well aware of the stakes; piling the pressure on isn't helpful.
STR-1:

KEY-531528: Let everyone else talk, we know what we need to do.
STR-1:

KEY-531529: This is the time for us to focus on ourselves to get the job done!
STR-1:

KEY-531530: This is a great opportunity for us to achieve our goals. Let's make it count.
STR-1:

KEY-531531: Here's our chance, lads, let's take it!
STR-1:

KEY-531532: It'd be great to clinch promotion but we've had a great season regardless and I'd like that to be recognised.
STR-1:

KEY-531533: We all want promotion but I don't think it's fair to suddenly start suggesting we expected to be in this position[%person#2-hidden].
STR-1:

KEY-531534: I can't agree; we stand the best chance of winning by retaining our composure.
STR-1:

KEY-531535: This isn't the time for us to hype up the importance of the match. We need to treat it like any other occasion and play our natural game.
STR-1:

KEY-531536: This title is ours and anyone who wants it will have to wrestle it away from us.
STR-1:

KEY-531537: We're not going to let this slip. This title is ours.
STR-1:

KEY-531538: This isn't the right time to put even more pressure on us.
STR-1:

KEY-531539: Why are [%person#2-you] piling the pressure on us at a time like this?
STR-1:

KEY-531540: We know what's at stake, let's get it done.
STR-1:

KEY-531541: Come on lads, this is a huge game! Let's give it everything we've got.
STR-1:

KEY-531542: We've giving it everything; asking for even more is a bit unnecessary.
STR-1:

KEY-531543: Why are [%person#2-you] asking us to give even more when it's clear we're 100% committed already?
STR-1:

KEY-531544: We can only control our own performance. Make sure we play as well as we can and see what happens.
STR-1:

KEY-531545: Give it everything we've got and then we can't have any regrets!
STR-1:

KEY-531546: Surely [%person#2-you]'re not underestimating just how important this match is?
STR-1:

KEY-531547: Why are [%person#2-you] downplaying one of the most important matches any of us will play in?
STR-1:

KEY-531548: We've surprised so many people this season that we should be very proud whatever happens from now on.
STR-1:

KEY-531549: This has been an outstanding run and anything else that comes along is very much a bonus at this stage.
STR-1:

KEY-531550: I'm sure none of us want to lose a cup final. We're ready.
STR-1:

KEY-531551: I certainly don't want to lose a cup final and I won't even contemplate the idea.
STR-1:

KEY-531552: This is a massive match and I'm sure we're all going to give it one hundred percent.
STR-1:

KEY-531553: We know what's at stake and nobody wants to let the team down!
STR-1:

KEY-531554: As long as we can look each other in the eye come full time, we'll be fine.
STR-1:

KEY-531555: We need to make sure we play our game and let everything else work itself out.
STR-1:

KEY-531556: This is a much bigger match than [%person#2-you] seem to think it is.
STR-1:

KEY-531557: Why are [%person#2-you] playing down just how important this match is?
STR-1:

KEY-531558: We've come so far already that everything else is really just a bonus.
STR-1:

KEY-531559: Nobody expected us to be where we are, so enjoy it, and try to keep causing upsets!
STR-1:

KEY-531560: Nothing else from me, no.
STR-1:

KEY-531561: That's all I have to say.
STR-1:

KEY-531562: Apparently some of you aren't happy with how things have been going. What's up?
STR-1:

KEY-531563: [%person#2-You] shouldn't have sold [%male#4] and we're all owed an explanation.
STR-1:

KEY-531564: Why was [%male#4] sold? It's a terrible decision.
STR-1:

KEY-531565: It's alright, we've already identified potential replacements, and we'll be working towards a deal soon.
STR-1:

KEY-531566: Players will always come and go but this team remains; it's a strong squad and we won't feel his loss.
STR-1:

KEY-531567: Alright, [%person#2-you] seem to be in control of the situation, so let's wait and see.
STR-1:

KEY-531568: It's good to hear that [%person#2-you]'re on top of this. Let's give it some to see how things unfold.
STR-1:

KEY-531569: Apparently some of you aren't happy with how things have been going lately. What's up?
STR-1:

KEY-531570: [%male#3-first] was asking for more playing time because he clearly deserves it, and the way [%person#2-you] treated him was really unfair.
STR-1:

KEY-531571: [%person#2-Your] treatment of [%male#3-first] for having the temerity to ask for more playing time, which he deserves by the way, was terrible and really upsetting for many of us.
STR-1:

KEY-531572: If he got his way, someone else more deserving misses out, and we'd probably be having a similar conversation. [%person#1-I] can't win, but [%person#1-I] have to make the choice that seems most appropriate at the time.
STR-1:

KEY-531573: He can have what he wants when he improves. How would you all feel if [%person#1-I] gave him more playing time when he wasn't up to it?
STR-1:

KEY-531574: [%person#1-I]'m surprised this has become an issue for some of you. The easy thing would be to give him what he wants so [%person#1-I]'ll try to do that.
STR-1:

KEY-531575: [%person#1-I] won't allow one player to create problems for the rest of the team. [%person#1-I] made this decision with everyone's best interests in mind.
STR-1:

KEY-531576: That's fair enough, I understand.
STR-1:

KEY-531577: Great, thank [%person#2-you] for explaining [%person#2-your] side of things.
STR-1:

KEY-531578: Play him or lose him, it's [%person#2-your] job at stake.
STR-1:

KEY-531579: If [%person#2-you] don't play him, [%person#2-you]'ll lose him, and that would be disastrous for the club.
STR-1:

KEY-531580: Surely [%person#2-you] can see that he deserves to play more often?
STR-1:

KEY-531581: I think he deserves to play more, and I'm not alone in that.
STR-1:

KEY-531582: Thank [%person#2-you] for listening, hopefully we'll get to see more of him soon.
STR-1:

KEY-531583: Great! Thank [%person#2-you] for understanding, and I hope we can move on from this quickly.
STR-1:

KEY-531584: [%person#2-You]'re taking a big risk here, he could leave, and that would not be a good outcome.
STR-1:

KEY-531585: [%person#2-You] can't claim to be acting in the club's best interests if [%person#2-your] decisions lead to a good player wanting to leave. Come on, be fair.
STR-1:

KEY-531586: None of us want to see him leave so, if giving him the playing time he wants keeps him here, [%person#1-I]'ll do that.
STR-1:

KEY-531587: [%person#1-I]'ve listened to your concerns but [%person#1-I] won't be changing [%person#1-my] mind. It's time to move on.
STR-1:

KEY-531588: I won't lie, it's not going to be easy coming to work knowing this is how [%person#2-you] treat my team-mates.
STR-1:

KEY-531589: If this is how [%person#2-you]'re going to treat my players and team-mates then I have to consider my future at the club.
STR-1:

KEY-531590: [%person#1-I]'d rather avoid big problems so if we can sort this out as a leadership group it'd be very helpful.
STR-1:

KEY-531591: We need help [%position#3-sentence] and we need it now.
STR-1:

KEY-531592: [%person#2-You] have to improve the squad [%position#3-sentence], we're crying out for help there.
STR-1:

KEY-531593: [%person#1-I] think we have good quality throughout the squad and some really gifted young players ready to make an impact. They're who [%person#2-I]'m focusing on.
STR-1:

KEY-531594: Yeah [%person#1-I] know, we'll try out best to do some transfer business, don't worry.
STR-1:

KEY-531595: It's nice to hear [%person#2-you] talking up the next generation and it'd be great if they could make an impact.
STR-1:

KEY-531596: The young talent we have here is so exciting, it's great to hear [%person#2-you] say they're going to get a chance.
STR-1:

KEY-531597: That's very encouraging to hear; I'm looking forward to seeing who comes in.
STR-1:

KEY-531598: I can't wait to see who [%person#2-you] bring in!
STR-1:

KEY-531599: Some of us no longer feel [%person#2-you]'re right to manage this team and that [%person#2-you]'ve lost the dressing room.
STR-1:

KEY-531600: [%person#2-You] no longer command the same support in the dressing room that [%person#2-you] once did and it might be time for a change.
STR-1:

KEY-531601: [%person#1-I] know things aren't going well but [%person#1-I]'m working hard to improve things and [%person#1-I] hope you all are too.
STR-1:

KEY-531602: [%person#2-You]'re clearly trying, so it's only fair to give [%person#2-you] some time to turn things around.
STR-1:

KEY-531603: Alright, [%person#2-you] clearly deserve more time to fix things, so I'm happy to leave it there.
STR-1:

KEY-531604: Don't blame us for [%person#2-your] inability to get the best out of [%person#2-your] players, it's management like this that has got [%person#2-you] into this situation.
STR-1:

KEY-531605: Apparently some of you aren't happy with [%person#1-my] treatment of [%male#3]. What's going on?
STR-1:

KEY-531606: Why doesn't [%male#3-first] deserve a new contract? We think he does.
STR-1:

KEY-531607: [%person#2-You] should offer him the new contract he wants. He's absolutely deserving of one.
STR-1:

KEY-531608: He's asking for absolutely unreasonable things. If he got his way you'd all be queueing up behind him for your new deals too.
STR-1:

KEY-531609: Have a think about it; if he went about it the right way, he'd get everything he wants at the right time and in the right way. That isn't the case right now.
STR-1:

KEY-531610: [%person#1-I] won't be bullied into giving him what he wants. [%person#1-I]'m the manager.
STR-1:

KEY-531611: Look, if it keeps everyone happy, he can have a new deal. Good?
STR-1:

KEY-531612: [%person#1-I]'ve listened but [%person#1-I]'m not convinced. Get back to work.
STR-1:

KEY-531613: [%person#1-I]'ve made this decision with the club's best interests at heart, as always.
STR-1:

KEY-531614: Yeah, that's fair enough, maybe he should be more patient.
STR-1:

KEY-531615: That's fair enough, I see where [%person#2-you]'re coming from.
STR-1:

KEY-531616: He's done as much as he can to earn a new deal. What else is he meant to do?
STR-1:

KEY-531617: I guess I don't know what else any of us are meant to do if he's not deserving of a new deal.
STR-1:

KEY-531618: Yeah, that's fair enough, I understand.
STR-1:

KEY-531619: What do any of us have to do to deserve a new contract then?
STR-1:

KEY-531620: If it's going to be this hard to get a new deal then players will simply leave.
STR-1:

KEY-531621: Thanks for coming around, [%person#2-you] won't regret it.
STR-1:

KEY-531622: Excellent, thank [%person#2-you] for listening and understanding.
STR-1:

KEY-531623: We all want what's best for the team but maybe we should leave it at that for now.
STR-1:

KEY-531624: I want what's best for the team too, but let's leave it there.
STR-1:

KEY-531625: I don't think [%person#2-you] have the best interests of the team at heart when players are unhappy.
STR-1:

KEY-531626: [%person#2-You] don't have the team's best interests at heart because the players are unhappy, it's that simple.
STR-1:

KEY-531627: Okay, [%person#1-I]'ll enter into negotiations with him if it'll make everyone happy.
STR-1:

KEY-531628: [%person#1-I] don't want to waste any more time on this; some of you clearly understand where [%person#1-I]'m coming from, and everyone else needs to accept that [%person#1-I]'ve made [%person#1-my] decision.
STR-1:

KEY-531629: Okay, let's give [%person#2-you] a chance to sort this situation out.
STR-1:

KEY-531630: I'm prepared to give [%person#2-you] a chance to offer him the deal he's seeking but I don't want to be let down.
STR-1:

KEY-531631: [%person#1-I] said we'd talk at the end of the season and he chose to turn that down. That's his fault.
STR-1:

KEY-531632: His side of the story is a bit different but I think it's time to step back and give [%person#2-you] the benefit of the doubt.
STR-1:

KEY-531633: Alright, if that's what [%person#2-you] say happened, I'll say no more.
STR-1:

KEY-531634: He deserves a new deal now and [%person#2-you] keep on stalling, that's why he's frustrated.
STR-1:

KEY-531635: Stop wasting his time and give him the deal [%person#2-you]'re eventually going to offer him.
STR-1:

KEY-531636: [%person#2-You] need to do something about the dressing room atmosphere, it's a real chore to come to work at the moment, and that's not a good situation to be in.
STR-1:

KEY-531637: The atmosphere around here right now is terrible, I hate it, and [%person#2-you] need to do something to change it.
STR-1:

KEY-531638: [%person#1-I] know things are bad but [%person#1-I]'m working as hard as [%person#1-I] can to improve the situation.
STR-1:

KEY-531639: Just do your jobs as footballers and everything else will take care of itself.
STR-1:

KEY-531640: That's really good to know, thanks. Hopefully [%person#2-you]'re able to affect real change.
STR-1:

KEY-531641: That's great to know, hopefully [%person#2-you] can bring about real positive changes.
STR-1:

KEY-531642: [%person#2-You]'re right, if we can win consistently, everyone will be much happier.
STR-1:

KEY-531643: That's right, we have to focus on our game, and let everything else sort itself out.
STR-1:

KEY-531644: We won't win consistently without a happy workplace and that's [%person#2-your] responsibility to cultivate.
STR-1:

KEY-531645: We need to be happy and be able to enjoy our football and [%person#2-you]'re not making that easy at all.
STR-1:

KEY-531646: Why aren't [%person#2-you] doing more to give [%male#3] the assurances he wants about his playing time?
STR-1:

KEY-531647: [%male#3] wants to be assured about how often he's going to play and it's not right that [%person#2-you]'re ignoring him.
STR-1:

KEY-531648: [%person#1-I]'d offer him those assurances if he deserved them. As it is, he doesn't, and [%person#1-I]'d be lying to him if [%person#1-I] did what you're asking.
STR-1:

KEY-531649: All he has to do is play well when he's on the pitch and he'll get all the assurances he wants.
STR-1:

KEY-531650: [%person#1-I]'m happy to talk to him any time and let him know he can earn all the playing time he wants.
STR-1:

KEY-531651: [%person#1-I] have to manage the whole team, not one player, and you'd all do well to realise that.
STR-1:

KEY-531652: Fair enough, [%person#2-you]'ve got a decent explanation.
STR-1:

KEY-531653: Alright, that makes sense, we should move on.
STR-1:

KEY-531654: A little goes a long way but all [%person#2-you]'re doing here is making bigger problems for [%person#2-yourself].
STR-1:

KEY-531655: He's making a perfectly reasonable request but [%person#2-you]'re making life unnecessarily hard for him. That's worrying for some of us.
STR-1:

KEY-531656: [%person#2-You] seem to have control of the situation and I'm happy enough with that.
STR-1:

KEY-531657: It's good to hear that [%person#2-you] have a full understanding of the situation. Let's try to forget about it.
STR-1:

KEY-531658: [%person#2-You] should be more open and honest with all of us, it'd help avoid causing so many problems.
STR-1:

KEY-531659: So much of this could've been avoided if [%person#2-you] were just a little more open with us. It would be such a big help.
STR-1:

KEY-531660: [%person#2-Your] apology is appreciated and hopefully the situation will soon be resolved.
STR-1:

KEY-531661: Thank [%person#2-you] for apologising. Hopefully we can soon put all of this behind us as move forward as a team.
STR-1:

KEY-531662: [%person#2-You]'re the manager and maybe we should've given [%person#2-you] the benefit of the doubt.
STR-1:

KEY-531663: Okay, perhaps we've been a bit over the top in our criticism and instead we should've recognised that [%person#2-you]'re in charge for a reason.
STR-1:

KEY-531664: How can [%person#2-you] say it's in the best interests of the team if players are unhappy?
STR-1:

KEY-531665: It can't be good for the team if a player is unhappy though.
STR-1:

KEY-531666: [%person#2-Your] team talks have been confusing and concerning and some of us would like to see a change of approach.
STR-1:

KEY-531667: [%person#2-You] need to improve the way [%person#2-you] approach team talks, they're simply not working for some of us.
STR-1:

KEY-531668: [%person#1-I] think [%person#1-my] team talks have been fine and there won't be any changes at this time.
STR-1:

KEY-531669: [%person#1-I]'m really surprised to hear that. [%person#1-I]'m not here to tell you all want you want to hear, [%person#1-I]'m here to get results, and it's time you all understood that.
STR-1:

KEY-531670: [%person#1-I]'m happy to try to make a change if you feel a change needs to be made. We're here to work together, not against each other.
STR-1:

KEY-531671: [%person#1-I] really don't think any of [%person#1-my] team talks have been harsh. [%person#1-I] tell it like it is.
STR-1:

KEY-531672: [%person#2-You] don't seem interested in being constructive though; that would be a big change [%person#2-you] could make.
STR-1:

KEY-531673: Try actually being constructive, that's all I'm asking for.
STR-1:

KEY-531674: Come on, we're in the twenty-first century now. [%person#2-You] need to work with us, not against us.
STR-1:

KEY-531675: We're asking for nuance and detail rather than the approach [%person#2-you]'re currently adopting. Try it, [%person#2-you] might be surprised.
STR-1:

KEY-531676: Thank [%person#2-you] for apologising, hopefully the situation improves.
STR-1:

KEY-531677: I'm very happy to hear [%person#2-your] apology and I really hope we can move forward more positively.
STR-1:

KEY-531678: This isn't something that's going to go away, [%person#2-you]'re going to really alienate [%person#2-yourself].
STR-1:

KEY-531679: Look, if this carries on, [%person#2-you]'ll quickly find that [%person#2-your] support among the squad will disappear.
STR-1:

KEY-531680: This is just another reason to doubt [%person#2-you], it's not the right decision.
STR-1:

KEY-531681: If [%person#2-you] carry on like this [%person#2-you] might not have much longer here.
STR-1:

KEY-531682: Why are [%person#2-you] trying to force him out of the club? It doesn't seem fair.
STR-1:

KEY-531683: It's a disgrace that [%person#2-you]'re trying to force him out of the club.
STR-1:

KEY-531684: He's not of the required standard and, if we're going to realise our ambitions, we need to move on from him.
STR-1:

KEY-531685: [%person#1-I] know a lot of you are close with him but the time has come for him to leave. We can't allow sentimentality to cloud our judgement.
STR-1:

KEY-531686: Alright, [%person#1-I] don't want to cause any problems, so he can stay.
STR-1:

KEY-531687: [%person#1-I] listened out of courtesy but [%person#1-I]'m not interested in taking this discussion any further.
STR-1:

KEY-531688: [%person#1-I]'d urge everyone to look at the bigger picture and understand that we'll be in a position to strengthen the squad when he leaves.
STR-1:

KEY-531689: This really doesn't make sense and it's quite concerning.
STR-1:

KEY-531690: [%person#2-You]'re making a big mistake here and [%person#2-you] should reconsider.
STR-1:

KEY-531691: If [%person#2-you] don't think there's room for sentimentality then why should any of us trust [%person#2-you]?
STR-1:

KEY-531692: Well if that's how [%person#2-you] feel then I reckon plenty of us will have to think whether we really want to play for [%person#2-you] or not.
STR-1:

KEY-531693: Thank [%person#2-you], it'll be great to see him stay at the club.
STR-1:

KEY-531694: Good, hopefully that's the last we hear of the matter.
STR-1:

KEY-531695: This all seems so unnecessary, [%person#2-you]'d be weakening the squad if he leaves.
STR-1:

KEY-531696: I'm just concerned that we're making the squad weaker when we really don't have to.
STR-1:

KEY-531697: Alright, I'm prepared to give [%person#2-you] the benefit of the doubt for now.
STR-1:

KEY-531698: Alright, let's do it [%person#2-your] way. Don't let us down.
STR-1:

KEY-531699: [%person#2-You] can't claim it's good for the team when lots of us are unhappy.
STR-1:

KEY-531700: Some of us are really unhappy about this so how exactly is this good for the team?
STR-1:

KEY-531701: Alright, [%person#1-I]'ve clearly got this wrong, he can stay.
STR-1:

KEY-531702: [%person#1-I]'m in charge and, quite frankly, [%person#1-I] don't appreciate you all questioning [%person#1-my] decisions. [%person#1-My] mind is made up.
STR-1:

KEY-531703: [%person#1-I]'ve listened to your concerns, and it's clear that some of you are fine with [%person#1-my] decision, so it's time to move on and accept the situation.
STR-1:

KEY-531704: Okay then, [%person#2-you]'ve said he'll stay, so we'll take [%person#2-you] at [%person#2-your] word.
STR-1:

KEY-531705: Good, now hopefully we can all move on from this.
STR-1:

KEY-531706: [%person#2-Your] decisions are unsettling and some of us are increasingly doubtful about whether or not [%person#2-you] should be managing this club.
STR-1:

KEY-531707: To be honest, I think a few of us are starting to doubt whether [%person#2-you]'re the right manager for this club because of this.
STR-1:

KEY-531708: Unfortunately, we have to abide by Financial Fair Play, and we had to sell him for that reason.
STR-1:

KEY-531709: We know the reasons, we just don't like them.
STR-1:

KEY-531710: [%person#2-You] can make all the excuses [%person#2-you] like, it won't fix this.
STR-1:

KEY-531711: Let [%male#3-first] leave; no player should be held here against their will.
STR-1:

KEY-531712: [%person#2-You] should let him leave if he wants to leave. Everyone should be able to explore opportunities when they present themselves.
STR-1:

KEY-531713: [%person#1-I]'m not in the business of letting good players leave and weakening our squad. Why would any of you want that to happen?
STR-1:

KEY-531714: [%person#1-I] won't let any player bully the club into letting them get their way. That's not how proper business is done.
STR-1:

KEY-531715: [%person#1-I] don't want to sell him but, if it makes everyone happy, maybe [%person#1-I]'ll have to.
STR-1:

KEY-531716: [%person#1-I]'m not interested in anyone's complaints, we're doing things [%person#1-my] way, so get used to it.
STR-1:

KEY-531717: [%person#1-I] always want to do right by the team and the club and that's the case here. We can't let good players leave.
STR-1:

KEY-531718: Yeah, that's fair enough, we shouldn't be so quick in wanting a good player to leave.
STR-1:

KEY-531719: What good is it going to do keeping him here if he doesn't want to be here though?
STR-1:

KEY-531720: if [%person#2-you] force him to stay then it'll only cause bigger problems for everyone.
STR-1:

KEY-531721: Alright, I understand that someone has to be in charge, and that's the right decision from [%person#2-your] perspective.
STR-1:

KEY-531722: [%person#2-You]'re just being stubborn now though, and that doesn't help anyone.
STR-1:

KEY-531723: [%person#2-Your] stubbornness is going to ruin his career though. What sort of message does that send to the rest of the squad?
STR-1:

KEY-531724: Good, hopefully that's the end of this matter.
STR-1:

KEY-531725: Excellent, I'm glad [%person#2-you]'ve seen sense.
STR-1:

KEY-531726: Unfortunately, the damage may already be done.
STR-1:

KEY-531727: [%person#2-You]'ve already let a lot of us down I'm afraid.
STR-1:

KEY-531728: I guess that's fair, sorry for doubting [%person#2-you].
STR-1:

KEY-531729: I just don't think it's a good idea to keep players around when they clearly don't want to be here.
STR-1:

KEY-531730: Surely [%person#2-you] can see it doesn't make sense to keep unhappy players at the club?
STR-1:

KEY-531731: Fine, [%person#1-I]'ll let him go then.
STR-1:

KEY-531732: [%person#1-I]'ve given everyone a chance to make their case and [%person#1-I]'m not going to waste any more time. Leave this alone and get on with your football.
STR-1:

KEY-531733: I'm pretty disappointed with how [%person#1-you]'ve handled this to be honest.
STR-1:

KEY-531734: [%person#2-You] haven't exactly handled this one well.
STR-1:

KEY-531735: We're not sure what [%person#2-you] have against him but it's concerning for a few of us.
STR-1:

KEY-531736: Why are [%person#2-you] treating him with such a blatant lack of respect?
STR-1:

KEY-531737: Clearly [%person#1-I] disagree, he's been treated perfectly well considering the circumstances.
STR-1:

KEY-531738: [%person#1-I] hadn't realised there was even a problem, and [%person#1-I] really do apologise. [%person#1-I]'ll try to act differently in future.
STR-1:

KEY-531739: [%person#1-I] did what [%person#1-I] thought was best for the team. That's all [%person#1-I] ever do and [%person#1-I] know not everyone is going to agree with [%person#1-me].
STR-1:

KEY-531740: Fair enough, it can't be easy for [%person#2-you], so I'll say no more.
STR-1:

KEY-531741: [%person#2-You]'re the manager, it's time we all respected [%person#2-you] more.
STR-1:

KEY-531742: [%person#2-You]'re getting the big decisions wrong though, and that's really worrying.
STR-1:

KEY-531743: [%person#2-You]'re paid to make the big decisions and, when [%person#2-you] get them wrong, there will be consequences.
STR-1:

KEY-531744: Okay, thank [%person#2-you] for apologising.
STR-1:

KEY-531745: Great, thank [%person#2-you]. Let's try to move on from this positively.
STR-1:

KEY-531746: Fine, [%person#2-you]'re in charge, and we'd all do well to remember that.
STR-1:

KEY-531747: [%person#2-You]'re the manager and [%person#2-you]'re right, we should all acknowledge that, even if we privately disagree.
STR-1:

KEY-531748: Alright, [%person#1-I]'ve clearly got this wrong, and [%person#1-I] sincerely apologise.
STR-1:

KEY-531749: Alright, [%person#1-I] have to draw a line under this. Thank you to those of you who understand, and [%person#1-I] appreciate the rest of you airing your concerns, but it's time to move on.
STR-1:

KEY-531750: [%person#2-You]'re making decisions that are going to leave several players questioning their futures at the club.
STR-1:

KEY-531751: I'm just worried that [%person#2-you]'re setting a trend for how [%person#2-you]'re going to manage this team moving forward.
STR-1:

KEY-531752: [%person#2-You] haven't been making the best decisions lately and we're struggling as a result.
STR-1:

KEY-531753: We're really struggling right now and, as manager, the responsibility for that lies with [%person#2-you].
STR-1:

KEY-531754: Believe [%person#1-me], [%person#1-I] know all too well that we're not performing as we should. [%person#1-I]'ve decided to make some tactical changes and we'll be implementing those in the coming days and weeks.
STR-1:

KEY-531755: That's really encouraging to hear, thanks. Hopefully a new way of playing will see our fortunes improve.
STR-1:

KEY-531756: Brilliant, it's great to hear that [%person#2-you]'re already trying to improve matters.
STR-1:

KEY-531757: [%person#2-You]'re essentially stalling for time and, realistically, things aren't going to improve unless [%person#2-you] leave.
STR-1:

KEY-531758: I don't want to be the one to say this but perhaps [%person#2-you]'ve reached the end of [%person#2-your] time here.
STR-1:

KEY-531759: [%person#1-I]'ll do whatever it takes to turn things around, including tactical changes if they're needed.
STR-1:

KEY-531760: [%person#2-You]'re saying all the right things, I really hope [%person#2-you]'re able to put us back on the right track.
STR-1:

KEY-531761: I have to admit that sounds exciting and [%person#2-you] have my support at least.
STR-1:

KEY-531762: There's no way [%person#2-you] can claim it's in the team's best interests if we lose a good player because of it.
STR-1:

KEY-531763: Give over, [%person#2-you]'re risking losing one of our best players, how can [%person#2-you] claim it's in the club's best interests?
STR-1:

KEY-531764: Look, [%person#1-I]'ve listened, and [%person#1-I] stand my [%person#1-my] decision. It's time to move on.
STR-1:

KEY-531765: How am I supposed to focus on the football knowing this is how [%person#2-you] treat my team-mates?
STR-1:

KEY-531766: It's too late, I can't focus on football when [%person#2-you] treat my friends like this.
STR-1:

KEY-531767: [%person#2-You] shouldn't have given in to [%male#3-first], he doesn't deserve what he's asking for.
STR-1:

KEY-531768: All [%person#1-I] ever try to do is the best for the club and it'd be nice if everyone understood that.
STR-1:

KEY-531769: What sort of message does this send to the rest of the team? [%person#2-You]'ve created a problem for [%person#2-yourself] now.
STR-1:

KEY-531770: What [%person#2-you]'ve done here is allowed everyone else to think they can get what they want by complaining and that's a big problem.
STR-1:

KEY-531771: All I've taken from this meeting is that [%person#2-you]'re the type of manager who lets their players get away with whatever they want if they complain loudly enough. I've lost a lot of faith in [%person#2-your] management skills over this.
STR-1:

KEY-531772: Selling [%male#3] was a terrible decision and it's really going to weaken us.
STR-1:

KEY-531773: We cannot believe [%male#3] was allowed to leave and it's upsetting on both personal and professional levels.
STR-1:

KEY-531774: It's reassuring to hear that [%person#2-you]'re on top of things, thanks.
STR-1:

KEY-531775: Great stuff, I can't wait to see who [%person#2-you] bring in.
STR-1:

KEY-531776: All this has taught me is that [%person#2-your] management skills really need a lot of work, [%person#2-you]'re going to have a dressing room revolt on [%person#2-your] hands if [%person#2-you]'re not careful.
STR-1:

KEY-531777: Let's not risk ruining the positive atmosphere around the club; forget about it and focus on your football.
STR-1:

KEY-531778: [%person#1-I] think most of the players have [%person#1-my] back so let's try to move on from this now, please.
STR-1:

KEY-531779: Yeah, we can't let this ruin the good feeling around the place, let's move on.
STR-1:

KEY-531780: We're only going to achieve our aims as a team, and we need positivity for that, so let's leave it there.
STR-1:

KEY-531781: This is bigger than the dressing room atmosphere, [%person#2-you]'re trying to distract us and it's not going to work.
STR-1:

KEY-531782: If [%person#2-you] don't reconsider then the atmosphere is going to be the least of [%person#2-your] problems.
STR-1:

KEY-531783: That's fair, if most players support [%person#2-you], it suggests we all should.
STR-1:

KEY-531784: When [%person#2-you] put it like that, I understand completely.
STR-1:

KEY-531785: [%person#1-I] have to be honest and apologise, it's clear that [%person#1-I] haven't handled this well, but [%person#1-I] will learn from it and do better in future.
STR-1:

KEY-531786: [%person#1-I] won't have [%person#1-my] authority questioned. Forget about this and get on with your football.
STR-1:

KEY-531787: The damage might already be done and [%person#2-you]'ve got a big task ahead of [%person#2-you] to restore our collective faith in [%person#2-you].
STR-1:

KEY-531788: It's too late, [%person#2-you]'ve shown us all just what sort of manager [%person#2-you] are, and I for one have lost faith in [%person#2-your] leadership.
STR-1:

KEY-531789: We're going along pretty nicely at the moment but this is the time to step it up a notch and make sure we qualify with ease.
STR-1:

KEY-531790: For those of you here for the first time, this is an opportunity to prove you belong at international level, and to make sure you earn more call-ups in future.
STR-1:

KEY-531791: Look, lots of you have plenty of international experience, and this is where we need it the most. You have to lead.
STR-1:

KEY-531792: This is the perfect opportunity for the more inexperienced members of this squad to step up and show that you can take this team into the next era. It's your chance to shine.
STR-1:

KEY-531793: Come on lads, we can really achieve something special here!
STR-1:

KEY-531794: If we can realise our potential in this tournament we can go down as legends!
STR-1:

KEY-531795: I'm so happy to see so many options in this squad, it can only be good for the team now and in the future.
STR-1:

KEY-531796: We have so much talent coming through, it's exciting!
STR-1:

KEY-531797: Having a look at new players is good, but there's a place and a time for it, and this is neither.
STR-1:

KEY-531798: I think we're running the risk of failure just because [%person#2-you] want to take a look at players with less experience.
STR-1:

KEY-531799: Everyone here knows what it takes to get the job done. The time is now.
STR-1:

KEY-531800: We have all the experience we could ever need right here in this room. It's time to make it count.
STR-1:

KEY-531801: Experienced players get old pretty quickly. Do [%person#2-you] not think we need some younger options?
STR-1:

KEY-531802: We need to refresh this squad and we need to do it right now.
STR-1:

KEY-531803: This really feels like the start of a new era for the country and it's so exciting!
STR-1:

KEY-531804: I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels that this could be the start of something special for [%nation#1-short]!
STR-1:

KEY-531805: There isn't enough experience in this squad, that much is clear.
STR-1:

KEY-531806: We're not going to achieve anything with this squad, it lacks the necessary experience.
STR-1:

KEY-531807: [%person#1-I]'ll get going now then if that's everything. See [%person#2-you] later.
STR-1:

KEY-531808: Alright then, [%person#1-I]'ll see [%person#2-you] later.
STR-1:

KEY-531809: Thanks a lot, see [%person#2-you] around.
STR-1:

KEY-531810: Okay, that all sounds good. Let [%person#1-me] know if [%person#2-you] need anything else.
STR-1:

KEY-531811: Right, it looks like we're done here.
STR-1:

KEY-531812: [%person#1-I]'m going to go but [%person#1-I]'m not happy with how this has gone.
STR-1:

KEY-531813: [%person#1-I] don't want to talk about this anymore so [%person#1-I]'m just going to leave.
STR-1:

KEY-531814: This recent spell of form is the perfect platform for us to take our game to the next level and really push on towards our targets. Let's make it happen.
STR-1:

KEY-531815: [%person#1-I]'m really pleased with how we've been playing recently, keep it up!
STR-1:

KEY-531816: Look, [%person#1-I] know it's not been easy recently, but we're good enough to turn things around as long as we stay focused and remain positive.
STR-1:

KEY-531817: [%person#1-I] really think we can win the title if we continue to play as well as we have so far this season. It's there for us if we want it!
STR-1:

KEY-531818: We're closing in on the title but we're not there yet. Keep playing the way you have all season and we'll soon be celebrating.
STR-1:

KEY-531819: It's more important than ever that we stay focused; form is temporary but class is permanent and we can still win this title.
STR-1:

KEY-531820: We've proved so many people wrong this season, keep going and we'll be playing at this level again next season to cause even more shocks.
STR-1:

KEY-531821: We all knew this season wasn't going to be easy, but don't let a little run of poor form get you down. Keep working hard and we will avoid relegation.
STR-1:

KEY-531822: [%person#1-I] don't want to say we're too good to be relegated but, come one, we are. Let's start playing to the level we're capable of reaching.
STR-1:

KEY-531823: [%person#1-I]'m delighted with our recent improvement in form, keep up the good work!
STR-1:

KEY-531824: Some of you might think it's too early in the season to worry about falling down the table but [%person#1-I] want things to improve before we have real problems on our hands.
STR-1:

KEY-531825: [%person#1-I]'m concerned by our slide down the table and we have to arrest that slump in form as soon as possible, no excuses.
STR-1:

KEY-531826: Don't let that last result affect you too much; we've been in good form, put it behind you and look to the next match.
STR-1:

KEY-531827: We haven't been playing well of late and hopefully we can use the most recent disappointment as motivation to turn things around.
STR-1:

KEY-531828: Don't let that defeat dampen what has been a really impressive start to the season. We still have every chance of making a strong title challenge.
STR-1:

KEY-531829: We've had an excellent first half of the season and none of us should lose confidence just because of one defeat. Our focus should be squarely on winning the title.
STR-1:

KEY-531830: You've all worked so hard all season to get into this position. One defeat won't undo all of that work, but let's make sure we get back to winning ways quickly and secure that title.
STR-1:

KEY-531831: Let's face it, none of us are happy with how the season has started, but we were much improved last time out. Let's use that to kick-start our campaign, there's no reason why we can't still make a strong title challenge.
STR-1:

KEY-531832: We've allowed our standards to slip a little lately, despite winning last time out, so let's make sure we recover our early-season form over the next few weeks to get back into the title race.
STR-1:

KEY-531833: We've been fantastic all season and the finish line is in sight, but we need to arrest this slump in form if we want to be champions. Hopefully winning last time out will sort us out.
STR-1:

KEY-531834: We've had a good start to the season and we're on track for promotion. Don't worry too much about losing our last match, there's plenty of time to make up for it.
STR-1:

KEY-531835: We're doing really well so far this season and, even though we lost our last match, our promotion prospects are still looking good.
STR-1:

KEY-531836: The season is nearly over and you've all done so well up to this point. We need to quickly forget about our disappointment last time out and lift ourselves again to go on and secure promotion.
STR-1:

KEY-531837: We haven't had a great start to the season, but we looked a lot better last time out, and [%person#1-I] believe we should still be aiming to secure promotion.
STR-1:

KEY-531838: Our focus should still be on promotion; our form might have deserted us but we're still good enough to make it happen, and there were some good signs in our last match.
STR-1:

KEY-531839: We should be looking back at this season as the one in which we clinched promotion. That win in our last match makes [%person#1-me] believe we can move on from our recent spell of poor form.
STR-1:

KEY-531840: After a start like we've had, we should finish the season comfortably safe from relegation. Don't be too concerned by our last result, we're in a good place.
STR-1:

KEY-531841: We've been doing well so far in our relegation battle and there were still positive signs in the last match despite the result.
STR-1:

KEY-531842: Everyone was expecting us to be relegated at this point. We've done so well to stay in the fight this long, so let's forget about the last match, and make one final push for survival.
STR-1:

KEY-531843: We have a lot of work do if we want to avoid the drop this season. Hopefully that win in our last match can be a turning point in our fight against relegation.
STR-1:

KEY-531844: We have struggled recently but we expected to go through spells like this over the course of the season. Let's use that win in our last match as the catalyst to revive our campaign.
STR-1:

KEY-531845: This has been a very difficult season for us, but winning last time out gives us a glimmer of hope that all is not yet lost. A good run of form can still keep us up, so let's give it everything we've got and try to avoid relegation.
STR-1:

KEY-531846: We're on a good run of form despite losing last time out and we're still looking good to make the playoffs.
STR-1:

KEY-531847: Our form hasn't been great lately but we looked much better in our last match. If we can carry that forward we can still make the playoffs.
STR-1:

KEY-531848: We've done really well to reach the playoffs, so there's no need to dwell on losing last time out. We've played well all season, so let's go and win the MLS Cup.
STR-1:

KEY-531849: You all showed [%person#1-me] something much better in that last match than most recent performances. Let's use that as motivation to push on and win the MLS Cup.
STR-1:

KEY-531850: That defeat in the last match was nothing more than a bump in the road. We're doing extremely well and we can absolutely reach the Final Series.
STR-1:

KEY-531851: Even though we won our last match, we're still not on course to reach the Final Series. However, if we can play like we did last time out, we still have a chance.
STR-1:

KEY-531852: Our recent form is a good sign ahead of the Final series. Even though we lost our last match, we have every reason to be confident.
STR-1:

KEY-531853: Well, we made the Final series despite a poor run of recent form. However, we can take confidence from our performance in our last match that we're getting back to our best.
STR-1:

KEY-531854: We may have had a poor result in our last match but, overall, we've had a great start to the season. We should have our eyes on the title.
STR-1:

KEY-531855: We're exceeding expectations so far this season and our form in this middle period of the campaign should not be forgotten because of one bad result. We should be looking to make a strong title challenge.
STR-1:

KEY-531856: We need to shrug off that defeat quickly; we've sustained a phenomenal title challenge all season and we can't let it slip at this stage.
STR-1:

KEY-531857: Well done on winning last time out, but [%person#1-I] think you'll all agree we just haven't been consistent enough so far this season. We need to perform like that on a regular basis if we want to win the title.
STR-1:

KEY-531858: We have obviously underperformed recently, but [%person#1-I] think that performance in our last match may be just what we needed to revive our title challenge.
STR-1:

KEY-531859: Our performances in recent weeks have put a dent in our title aspirations. Winning last time out was a good sign but we need to sustain that for the rest of the season if we want to become champions.
STR-1:

KEY-531860: Forget about the last match. We've had a strong start to the season and there's no need to lose hope in our promotion bid.
STR-1:

KEY-531861: We might have lost our last match, but our results in this middle part of the season have laid a solid foundation for our promotion challenge. There's no need to let our heads drop now.
STR-1:

KEY-531862: We've worked so hard all season to get into a position to clinch promotion. We were outplayed last time out but we cannot let one poor result cost us everything we've worked so hard for.
STR-1:

KEY-531863: It's still early days, but we haven't been good enough so far if we want to get promoted. Hopefully our most recent performance can act as a catalyst for a good run of form.
STR-1:

KEY-531864: Our form in this middle part of the season has hurt our promotion challenge. We need to string a few wins together if we want to get back in the race; our last performance will have helped a lot.
STR-1:

KEY-531865: Great win last time out, but let's not forget that our recent form has been poor. We still have a chance for promotion though, so let this be the turning point, and have a strong run-in.
STR-1:

KEY-531866: We've made an excellent start in our fight for survival. Don't let one defeat get you down, we're still in a good position.
STR-1:

KEY-531867: Despite losing our last match, we've been playing well of late. There is no reason to starting doubting our ability to avoid relegation now.
STR-1:

KEY-531868: We've put up a good fight late in the season, so don't worry about what happened last time out, our recent form should give us confidence we can avoid relegation.
STR-1:

KEY-531869: We looked much better in our last match than we have so far this season; we need to keep that up if we want to avoid relegation.
STR-1:

KEY-531870: We've hit a bit of a wall in the last few weeks, but we should be able to take confidence from that win in our last match, and push on to fight for our survival.
STR-1:

KEY-531871: If we can perform like we did in our last match for the rest of the season, we can still beat the drop. We played so much better than we have been playing.
STR-1:

KEY-531872: Even though we lost our last match, [%person#1-I] think it's important to acknowledge how well we've been playing recently. Keep it up.
STR-1:

KEY-531873: Our last match does not reflect how well we have played lately. Forget about the result and keep doing what you've been doing.
STR-1:

KEY-531874: The season is nearly over and our form is holding up. Let's put that last result behind us and finish the season strongly.
STR-1:

KEY-531875: This clearly hasn't been the start to the season we were hoping for, but we looked much better last time out, so let's use that to get back on track before things get out of control.
STR-1:

KEY-531876: Our recent dip in form has seen us slip down the table. There were, however, definite signs of improvement in our last match, so let's make sure we can keep that up.
STR-1:

KEY-531939: What has [%person#2-he] requested after winning? [%person#1-I]'m guessing [%person#2-he]'ll either ask for a statue or for the stadium to be named after [%person#2-him]. The last thing [%person#1-I]'m interested in is pandering to [%person#2-his] ego
STR-1:

KEY-531940: [%person#2] joined in the celebrations by praising [%person#1-your] recent success. Does it make things even sweeter when a rival is forced to give [%person#1-you] acclaim?

STR-1:

KEY-531943: As managers we all know how tough this job can be and [%person#1-I] think that's why [%person#2-first] conceded [%person#2-his] best wishes. [%person#1-I] gained a lot of respect for [%person#2-him] after reading [%person#2-his] comments

STR-1:

KEY-531950: [%person#2] failed to give [%person#1-you] any credit for [%person#1-your] recent success. Do [%person#1-you] think [%person#2-he]'s failing to look past the history the pair of you have?

STR-1:

KEY-531952: Every manager is entitled to their opinion. [%person#1-I] think [%person#2-first] is a pretty open book and, if [%person#2-he] doesn't feel we deserve praise, who am [%person#1-I] to tell [%person#2-him] otherwise?

STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-531968: [%person#1-I]'m not fooled by [%person#2-him] and nobody else should be either

STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-531974: Business is business. There's no need for [%person#1-me] to bring emotions into any potential discussions. That said, [%person#1-I] wouldn't mind squeezing a bit extra out of [%person#2-his] club!
STR-1:

KEY-531975: [%person#1-surname] won't do business with [%person#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-531976: Any transfer that could help [%person#2-him] is one [%person#1-I]'d rather steer clear of. The animosity between us is mutual; [%person#1-I]'ll never support decisions that could lead to him being successful
STR-1:

KEY-531977: [%person#1-surname] takes aim at [%person#2-surname] as transfer talk builds
STR-1:

KEY-531978: [%person#1-I] wouldn't have thought any of [%person#1-my] players would want to go and play for [%person#2-him]. That's normally a career-ending decision, unless [%person#2-he]'s going to get the boot soon
STR-1:

KEY-531979: [%person#2] seemed to suggest that any personal rivalries wouldn't affect a potential deal to sign one of [%person#2-his] players. Were [%person#1-you] surprised by [%person#2-his] comments?

STR-1:

KEY-531985: [%person#1-surname] suspicious of [%person#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-531986: [%person#1-I]'m a little taken aback by that. Any time [%person#2-first] is professional, [%person#1-I]'m immediately suspicious
STR-1:

KEY-531987: [%person#1-surname] doesn't trust [%person#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-531988: Maybe [%person#2-he]'s finally conceded that [%person#2-he]'ll always be second best to [%person#1-me]. [%person#1-I] never believe a word [%person#2-he] says; [%person#2-first] is happy to work the press and double-cross you behind closed doors
STR-1:

KEY-531989: [%person#2] seemed to suggest [%person#1-your] rivalry could scupper any potential deal for [%male#3]. What's [%person#1-your] reaction to [%person#2-his] comments?
STR-1:

KEY-531990: [%person#1-surname] understands [%person#2-surname]
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-531992: [%person#1-surname] dismisses [%person#2-surname]{s} comments
STR-1:

KEY-531993: There's no headline here. As managers, we only have so much control over transfers, and a relationship between two managers could never stop a deal happening[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1:

KEY-531994: [%person#1-surname] hits out at [%person#2-surname]
STR-1:

KEY-531995: Luckily, [%person#1-I] feel absolutely the same way, [%person#1-I]'m not interested in doing business with a manager who regularly cuts corners. If [%person#2-his] tactics are anything to go by, [%person#1-I]'d be terrified

KEY-531999: There's really nothing else to say right now
STR-1:

KEY-532000: [%person#1-surname] and [%person#2-surname] could resolve differences

STR-1:

KEY-532002: [%person#1-surname] happy to talk to [%person#2-surname]
STR-1:

STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-532007: [%person#2-He]'s not fooling [%person#1-me], that's for sure. [%person#1-I]'m not going to get drawn into [%person#2-his] games over a transfer deal
STR-1:

KEY-532008: Were [%person#1-you] disappointed that [%person#2-surname] seemed more interested in stoking the fires of your feud than doing anything towards resolving it?
STR-1:

KEY-532009: [%person#1-I] honestly couldn't care less
STR-1:

KEY-532010: [%person#1-surname] disappointed with [%person#2-surname]
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-532012: [%person#1-surname]: Best to ignore [%person#2-surname]

KEY-532014: [%person#1-surname] determined to see [%person#2-surname] fail
STR-1:

KEY-532015: [%person#1-My] resolve is even stronger to see him fail. It's not enough to see him struggle to succeed, [%person#2-he] has to fail
STR-1:

KEY-532016: [%person#1-I] won't be doing any business with him now, or ever for that matter. [%person#2-He] has to learn that [%person#2-his] words have consequences
STR-1:

KEY-532017: [%person#2] has recently been announced as [%team#2-short]{s} new manager. Despite being a rival of [%person#1-yours] in the past, do [%person#1-you] expect [%person#2-him] to prove to be a success at [%person#2-his] new side?

KEY-532018: [%person#1-I]'m just focused on [%person#1-my] club; [%person#1-I] don't pay much attention to manager movements elsewhere

STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-532037: [%person#2] pulled no punches in [%person#2-his] thoughts about [%person#1-your] new job. Do [%person#1-you] take notice of [%person#2-his] comments or will they provide extra motivation to succeed?

STR-1:

KEY-532045: [%person#1-I] ignore everything [%person#2-he] says. [%person#1-I] don't know how anyone puts up with [%person#2-him]; we certainly don't take our motivation through [%person#2-his] words and [%person#1-I]'d rather watch paint dry than listen to one of [%person#2-his] interviews
