KEY-538579: [%person#1-I] wanted to talk about your proposed asking price; although it doesn't matter right now as there's no interest in you, [%person#1-I] want to make sure we're in agreement.
STR-1: Tôi muốn nói về mức giá yêu cầu được đề xuất bởi bạn; mặc dù hiện tại không quan trọng vì tôi không có hứng thú với bạn, tôi muốn đảm bảo rằng chúng ta đồng ý.

KEY-538580: You're happy here so this shouldn't matter, but [%person#1-I] wanted to talk to you about our proposed asking price for you, to make sure we're both in agreement.
STR-1:

KEY-538581: [%person#1-I] had similar talks with [%male#5] and they were productive, so [%person#1-I]'d like to discuss your proposed asking price to make sure we're in agreement.
STR-1:

KEY-538582: [%person#1-I]'ve decided what your asking price should be in the current market and [%person#1-I]'m telling you out of courtesy. [%person#1-I] don't intend to have a discussion.
STR-1:

KEY-538583: Alright, I understand. Thanks.
STR-1: Được rồi, tôi hiểu rồi. Cảm ơn anh.

KEY-538584: That makes sense, thanks for explaining.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1: Điều đó có lý, cảm ơn đã giải thích.[%person#2-hidden]

KEY-538585: When [%person#2-you] put it like that I completely understand, thanks.
STR-1:

KEY-538586: I don't think it really reflects my value to be honest.
STR-1: Nói thật thì nó không phản ánh được giá trị của tôi.

KEY-538587: I disagree, it's an unrealistic representation of me as a footballer.
STR-1:

KEY-538588: That's rubbish, it's a completely unfair explanation on [%person#2-your] part.
STR-1: Thật là rác rưởi, phần giải thích của [%person#2-your] hoàn toàn không công bằng.

KEY-538589: I don't think my ability has anything to do with it.
STR-1: Tôi không nghĩ khả năng của tôi có liên quan gì đến nó

KEY-538590: My ability and my asking price shouldn't be related as far as I'm concerned.
STR-1: Khả năng và mức giá yêu cầu của tôi không nên liên quan đến mức độ tôi nghĩ

KEY-538591: [%person#2-You]'re using that as an excuse and I don't like it.
STR-1: [%person#2-You] đang sử dụng chúng như một lời xin lỗi và tôi không thích điều ấy

KEY-538592: That's not a fair explanation if [%person#2-you] ask me.
STR-1: Đó không phải là một lời giải thích công bằng, nếu anh hỏi tôi.

KEY-538593: I don't think that's a good enough reason.
STR-1: Tôi không nghĩ nó là lý do đủ tốt

KEY-538594: That's not a fair explanation and I think [%person#2-you] know it.
STR-1: Đó không phải là một lời giải thích hợp lí và tôi nghĩ anh biết điều đó.

KEY-538595: I disagree, judge me on my ability, not my potential.
STR-1: Tôi không đồng ý, đánh giá bằng khả năng của tôi, không phải tiềm năng.

STR-1: Tôi không nghĩ tiềm lực của tôi có bất kỳ điều gì để thực hiện chúng

STR-1:

KEY-538598: I don't think that makes much sense.
STR-1: Tôi không nghĩ điều đó có ý nghĩa

KEY-538599: I disagree, it shows that you're willing to sell me but only for an unreasonable fee.
STR-1: Tôi không đồng ý, nó cho thấy anh sẵn sàng bán tôi nhưng với một mức phí vô lý.

KEY-538600: I don't think anyone will be interested if [%person#2-your] asking price is that high, to be fair.
STR-1: Công bằng mà nói, tôi nghĩ sẽ không có ai quan tâm nếu mức giá yêu cầu của ông cao như vậy

KEY-538601: How will anyone be interested if the asking price is unfair?
STR-1: Làm thế nào mọi người sẽ quan tâm nếu giá chào bán là không hợp lý?

KEY-538602: Of course there's no interest, [%person#2-you]'re making incredibly unrealistic demands.
STR-1: [%person#2-you] Đương nhiên là nó không có lời rồi

KEY-538603: I wouldn't say I'm entirely happy here.
STR-1: Tôi không hoàn toàn hạnh phúc ở đây.

STR-1: Tôi không hạnh phúc ở đây vì vậy [%person#2-you] đừng có mà sử dụng lời bào chữa đó.

KEY-538606: I don't think my happiness has anything to do with it.
STR-1: Tôi không nghĩ hạnh phúc của tôi có liên quan gì đến chuyện đó.

KEY-538607: My asking price shouldn't be related to whether or not I'm happy here as far as I'm concerned.
STR-1: Mức giá yêu cầu của tôi không liên quan đến việc tôi có hài lòng ở đây hay không theo như tôi lo ngại

KEY-538608: I don't think [%male#5-first] has anything to do with it.
STR-1: Tôi không nghĩ [%male#5-first] có bất cứ điều gì để thực hiện nó

KEY-538609: Can we focus on me please? [%male#5-first] has nothing to do with it.
STR-1: Liệu chúng ta có thể tập trung vào tôi thôi chứ? [%male#5-first] không có gì để thực hiện nó

KEY-538610: [%person#2-You]'re using [%male#5-first] as an excuse and I don't like it.
STR-1:

KEY-538611: Fine, I'll get back to work.
STR-1: Được rồi, tôi sẽ quay lại làm việc.

KEY-538612: When [%person#2-you] put it like that I know what I should be doing instead, thanks.
STR-1: Khi [%person#2-you] đã nói như vậy thì tôi biết tôi nên làm gì thay thế, cảm ơn.

KEY-538613: I don't think that's very fair.
STR-1: Tôi không nghĩ vậy là công bằng.

KEY-538614: I expected [%person#2-you] to take my concerns seriously but apparently that was too much to hope for.
STR-1:

KEY-538615: That's rubbish, [%person#2-you] can't dodge my concerns forever.
STR-1:

KEY-538616: What price do [%person#2-you] consider fair?
STR-1:

KEY-538617: What's a fair price in [%person#2-your] opinion?
STR-1: Theo anh mức giá hợp lý là bao nhiêu?

KEY-538618: Go on then, let's hear a fair price?
STR-1: Tiếp tục đi, chúng ta hãy nghe một mức giá hợp lý chứ?

KEY-538619: How about this? Does that work?
STR-1: Thế này thì sao? Có được không?

KEY-538620: [%person#1-I] actually don't think this is going to help.
STR-1: [%person#1-I] không thực sự nghĩa rằng điều này giúp ích được gì.

KEY-538621: Well that's a disappointment.
STR-1: Thật đáng thất vọng.

KEY-538622: That's very frustrating, I guess we're not going to solve anything.
STR-1: Vậy thì cực kỳ bực bội, tôi đoán rằng chúng ta sẽ không giải quyết bất kỳ điều gì cả.

KEY-538623: Are [%person#2-you] kidding me?! I'm done here.
STR-1: Ông có đùa không? Tôi chán phải ở đây lắm rồi

KEY-538624: I can handle that.
STR-1: Tôi có thể xử lý được.

KEY-538625: Alright, that seems fine.
STR-1: Được rồi, điều đó có vẻ ổn.

KEY-538627: I still don't like it.
STR-1: Tôi vẫn không thích điều này.

KEY-538628: That's not really what I was expecting.
STR-1: Đó không phải là điều tôi mong đợi.

STR-1: Không, nó vẫn quá đắt đỏ

KEY-538630: That's still too high for me.
STR-1: Nó vẫn quá cao đối với tôi

KEY-538631: That's still very high and I'm not keen.
STR-1: Nó vẫn còn rất cao và tôi không còn nhiệt tình với nó nữa.

KEY-538632: Be realistic please, that's still unfairly high.
STR-1: Làm ơn thực tế đi, nó vẫn còn cao ngất ngưởng.

KEY-538633: Can we agree on this instead then?
STR-1: Thay vào đó, chúng ta có thể đồng ý về điều này không?

KEY-538634: [%person#1-I]'m not prepared to negotiate any further.
STR-1: Tôi vẫn chưa sẵng sàng để đàm phán xa hơn nữa

KEY-538635: Okay, that works.

KEY-538637: That's much more like it, thanks.
STR-1: Tôi thích thế này hơn, cảm ơn nhé.

KEY-538638: I still can't agree, sorry.
STR-1: Tôi vẫn không thể chấp nhận, tôi xin lỗi

KEY-538639: That's still not a number I can get on with.

STR-1: Như thế vẫn chưa đủ thấp.

KEY-538642: Nope, that's still too high.
STR-1: Không, nó vẫn quá cao

KEY-538643: Erm, that's higher than [%person#2-your] previous proposal...
STR-1: Ơ kìa, nó cao hơn đề xuất trước đó của [%person#2-your].

KEY-538644: ...but that's higher? Are [%person#2-you] sure?
STR-1: ...nhưng đấy là đắt ư? Anh [%person#2-you] chắc chứ?

KEY-538645: Are [%person#2-you] trying to make me angry? That's even higher!
STR-1:

KEY-538646: This is [%person#1-my] final offer.
STR-1:

KEY-538647: Alright, that'll do.
STR-1: Thê là được rồi.

KEY-538648: That works then, thanks.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1: Nó làm được rồi, cảm ơn ngen[%person#2-hidden]

KEY-538649: Great, that's much more like it. Thank you.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1: Tuyệt, thế thì tốt hơn hẳn. Cảm ơn anh.

KEY-538650: Unfortunately, I still can't accept that number.

KEY-538651: We're not going to come to an agreement here.
STR-1: Chúng ta không đạt được thoả thuận chung ở đây.

KEY-538652: I'm not going to agree on that number.

KEY-538653: It's still too high I'm afraid.
STR-1: Tôi e là nó vẫn còn còn quá cao

KEY-538654: I can't agree with a number that high.
STR-1: Tôi không thể đồng ý với mức giá cao như thế

KEY-538655: It's still too high and I'm wasting my time here now.
STR-1: Nó vẫn còn quá cao và tôi đang lãng phí thời gian ở đây

KEY-538656: Can we possibly negotiate it a little more?
STR-1: Chúng ta có thể thương lượng thêm một chút được không?

KEY-538657: [%person#1-I] really would implore you to understand why [%person#1-I]'m doing this.
STR-1: Tôi thực sự khẩn cầu anh hiểu tại sao tôi đang làm điều này.

KEY-538658: [%person#1-I]'ve listened out of courtesy but [%person#1-I]'m not going to waste much more of [%person#1-my] time on this.
STR-1: Tôi lắng nghe với tất cả sự nhã nhặn nhưng [%person#1-I] tôi sẽ không lãng phí nhiều [%person#1-my] thời gian cho vấn đề này.

KEY-538659: I'll drop it, thanks for explaining.[%person#2-hidden]
STR-1: Tôi sẽ bỏ qua. Cảm ơn vì đã giải thích. [%person#2-hidden]

KEY-538660: When [%person#2-you] put it like that I'll let it go, thanks.
STR-1: Khi ông nói như vậy, tôi sẽ cho qua, cảm ơn.

KEY-538661: I really can't let this one go, sorry.
STR-1: Tôi không thể bỏ qua chuyện này được, xin lỗi.

KEY-538662: This is my career we're talking about, I can't let it go quietly.
STR-1: Chúng ta đang nói tới sự nghiệp của tôi, tôi không thể để nó trôi qua một cách lặng lẽ

KEY-538663: I'm not going to let [%person#2-you] get away with this.
STR-1: Tôi sẽ không để anh thoát khỏi chuyện này đâu.

KEY-538664: I had some concerns about my asking price but I've since decided they're not that important.
STR-1: Tôi đã có một số lo lắng về giá chào bán của mình nhưng tôi đã quyết định rằng chúng không quan trọng như vậy nữa.

STR-1: Tôi không hài lòng về mức giá của mình nhưng sẽ không cần phải bàn về nó, chúng ta ổn mà.

KEY-538667: I think the club is asking too much for me, it's unrealistic to expect a team to pay that much.
STR-1:

KEY-538668: Why have [%person#2-you] put such an asking price on me? It's really not fair.
STR-1:

KEY-538669: [%person#2-Your] asking price for me is unrealistic and unfair and I won't accept it.
STR-1:

KEY-538670: Okay, [%person#1-I] admit that it's a little too high. [%person#1-I]'ll take care of it and make sure it's removed.
STR-1:

KEY-538671: [%person#1-I]'m prepared to talk about it, can we try to negotiate a fair price?
STR-1:

KEY-538672: It's entirely fair to ask for that much money for a player of your abilities.
STR-1:

KEY-538673: You have incredible potential and, if someone wants to buy you, it's going to cost them for the player you could end up becoming.
STR-1:

KEY-538674: That price shows how highly [%person#1-I] value you.
STR-1:

KEY-538675: [%person#1-I] don't think we need to talk about it, there's nobody interested in you, so right now it's just a number.
STR-1:

KEY-538676: You're happy here so why does it matter? It's just a number as far as [%person#1-I]'m concerned.
STR-1:

KEY-538677: [%male#5] didn't have any problems with a similar situation so [%person#1-I]'m not sure why you're worried.
STR-1:

KEY-538678: To be honest, [%person#1-I] don't care. [%person#1-I]'ve made a decision as manager and [%person#1-I] expect you to get on with it.
STR-1:

KEY-538679: Thanks, I appreciate it.
STR-1:

KEY-538680: That sounds good to me, thanks.
STR-1:

KEY-538681: Thanks, that's a massive relief for me.
STR-1:

KEY-538682: Alright, at this point [%person#1-I]'m prepared to back down and address your asking price to make sure we can both move on.
STR-1:

KEY-538683: [%person#1-I] got it wrong and [%person#1-I] apologise for that, but [%person#1-I]'m willing to make it up to you by giving you what you want.
STR-1:

KEY-538684: I don't want to cause any problems but I think I need to be recognised as an important player here to force my way into the [%nation#3] setup.
STR-1:

KEY-538685: I need to be playing for [%nation#3] and, for that to happen, I feel my importance to the team has to be formally recognised.
STR-1:

KEY-538686: Look, we all know I'm an important player here, and that needs to be properly recognised so that I can get into the [%nation#3] setup.
STR-1:

KEY-538687: I don't want to cause any problems but I think I need to be recognised as an important player here to help my chances of playing in the [%comp#3-short].

STR-1:

KEY-538691: I need to be playing for [%nation#3] and, for that to happen, I feel I have to be formally recognised as a regular starter.
STR-1:

STR-1:

KEY-538694: I need to be playing in the [%comp#3-short] and, for that to happen, I feel my role as a regular starter has to be formally recognised.
STR-1:

KEY-538695: I don't want to cause any problems but I think I need to be recognised as our first-choice goalkeeper to force my way into the [%nation#3] setup.
STR-1:

KEY-538696: I need to be playing for [%nation#3] and, for that to happen, I feel my role as first-choice goalkeeper has to be formally recognised.
STR-1:

KEY-538697: Look, we all know I deserve to be first-choice goalkeeper here, and that needs to be properly recognised so that I can get into the [%nation#3] setup.
STR-1:

KEY-538698: I don't want to cause any problems but I think I need to be recognised as our first-choice goalkeeper to help my chances of playing in the [%comp#3-short].

KEY-538699: I need to be playing in the [%comp#3-short] and, for that to happen, I feel my role as first-choice goalkeeper has to be formally recognised.
STR-1:

KEY-538700: Look, we all know I deserve to be our first-choice goalkeeper, and that needs to be properly recognised so that I can play in the [%comp#3-short].
STR-1:

KEY-538701: You're good enough to get in the national team on merit, regardless of how much football you're getting here.
STR-1:

KEY-538702: [%person#1-I]'m not sure you'll feature for the national team, regardless of how much football you play here. You're not quite at that level yet.
STR-1:

KEY-538703: You need to decide what's more important to you, club or country, and not let national team matters affect your career here.
STR-1:

KEY-538704: Okay, I understand, if I'm good enough they'll pick me.
STR-1:

KEY-538705: Alright, that makes sense. I'll wait to see if I get called up then.
STR-1:

KEY-538706: [%person#2-You]'re right, I get it. All I can do is to carry on working hard and hope for the best.
STR-1:

KEY-538707: It doesn't matter if I'm good enough or not, I need to be doing everything possible to aid my cause.
STR-1:

KEY-538708: If it was all about my ability as a footballer I'd be a regular for my country already, but I'm not.
STR-1:

KEY-538709: I don't really agree with that. If it's all about my ability, why am I not playing regular international football?
STR-1:

KEY-538710: I know I'm good enough but I'm not going to be complacent about it.
STR-1:

KEY-538711: I need assurances about playing time to make absolutely sure. Of course I know I'm good enough.
STR-1:

KEY-538712: I'm more than good enough but I have to make absolutely sure so there can be no excuses when it comes to picking me.
STR-1:

KEY-538713: Fair enough, maybe it's just not going to work out for me.
STR-1:

KEY-538714: I'm beginning to think that I really don't stand a chance and, if that's the case, so be it.
STR-1:

KEY-538715: Right, maybe international football isn't a level I can reach.
STR-1:

KEY-538716: I know I'm good enough and I will never stop believing that.
STR-1:

KEY-538717: I think I'm good enough to play for my country. Who is anyone to tell me otherwise?
STR-1:

KEY-538718: I'm good enough, [%person#2-you] can't tell me otherwise.
STR-1:

KEY-538719: I know it'll be hard but I have to do whatever I can to give myself a chance.
STR-1:

KEY-538720: I've never given up on a challenge before and I don't intend to now. I have to try every avenue open to me.
STR-1:

KEY-538721: Whether I'm good enough or not, I'm still going to try my best to go as far as I can.
STR-1:

KEY-538722: Alright, I guess club comes first.
STR-1:

KEY-538723: Fair enough, the club pays my wages, I should prioritise things accordingly.
STR-1:

KEY-538724: [%person#2-You]'re right, I have to put the club first.
STR-1:

KEY-538725: I don't think club football should necessarily come first. There's room for international success too.
STR-1:

KEY-538726: I want to play for my country; why should club football come first?
STR-1:

KEY-538727: Everyone dreams of playing for their country. That's the pinnacle of the game and it's what I want to do as often as I can.
STR-1:

KEY-538728: I know club football is important but there's room for international football too.
STR-1:

KEY-538729: I don't see why I can't harbour international ambitions alongside a club career.
STR-1:

KEY-538730: I want to play international football and have a good club career. It is possible to do both.
STR-1:

KEY-538731: I feel as though I need my agreed playing time sticking to in order for me to force my way into the [%nation#3] setup.
STR-1:

KEY-538732: I want to be playing for [%nation#3] so I need the playing time I was promised.
STR-1:

KEY-538733: The only way I'm going to get into the [%nation#3] setup is if I get the playing time we agreed to.
STR-1:

KEY-538734: I feel as though I need my agreed playing time sticking to in order for me to be able to play in the [%comp#3-short].

STR-1:

KEY-538736: The only way I'm going to play in the [%comp#3-short] is if I get the playing time we agreed to.
STR-1:

KEY-538737: You're good enough to get in the national team on merit, whether you get your agreed playing time or not.
STR-1:

KEY-538738: [%person#1-I]'m not sure you'll feature for the national team whether you get your agreed playing time here or not. You're not quite at the level they require at the moment.
STR-1:

KEY-538739: You need to decide what's more important to you, club or country, and not let national team matters affect your club career.
STR-1:

KEY-538740: I've come to ask [%person#2-you] for a transfer, I really want to try to force my way into the [%nation#3] setup and I feel like I need a move to a bigger club in order to make that happen.
STR-1:

KEY-538741: I'm at a stage of my career where I need to play for [%nation#3] and, for that to be possible, I need to join a bigger club.
STR-1:

KEY-538742: I need to leave for a bigger club so that I can play for [%nation#3], and I need [%person#2-you] to make that happen.
STR-1:

KEY-538743: [%person#1-I]'m not sure you'll feature for the national team, regardless of where you're playing your football, as you're not up to the standard required.
STR-1:

KEY-538744: You need to decide what's more important to you, club or country, and not let national team matters impact your club career.
STR-1:

KEY-538745: You're more than good enough to grow your international career while staying here. Your quality alone will see you given the chances you deserve.
STR-1:

KEY-538746: I've always got a chance but playing for a bigger club improves those chances.
STR-1:

KEY-538747: I don't think anyone can deny that playing for a bigger club gives me more of a chance.
STR-1:

KEY-538748: I know my chances will improve if I'm at a bigger club, it's as simple as that.

STR-1:
